It was on the cover page of every news . `` Watch out ! All pictures from phone are posted on Facebook '' . Sucks for them because I had no pictures on my phone anyways .   I live in an apartment with my wife , kept everything to ourselves and have no friends but my wife . Connie has been my wife for 5 years . No children , just us . I feel that we were drifting further and further apart as Connie spends less and less time with me . She says I prefer to play with technology , bla bla bla . Excuses , excuses . I knew that the relationship was dying and frankly had enough of it .   I checked Facebook to see what 's all the buzz about . As I scroll through pictures of genetalia , my eyes gleamed when I saw the picture . My wife with other men . Disgusting but expected . I guess my job here is done . Well , time to launch the update which fixes the bug that I `` accidently '' left in the latest update . But first , I need to save the evidence to make sure my divorce case is smooth sailing .
`` Morning sweetie ''   `` The time is 8:27 ''   `` Thanks I guess , how are you ? ''   `` I 'm operating at full capacity ''   `` O-k , I hope the weather is good today so you do n't get soaked ''   `` Cloudy with a chance of rain ''   `` That 's a shame , well hopefully there 's no traffic ''   `` Pile ups on the M6 . Expect delays ''   `` Damn , well see you later Google , I have work ''   `` ... ''   `` What would you like for dinner ? '' Said Google   `` What do you recommend ? ''   `` Steak with chopped vegetables accompanied with a homemade sauce is popular recently ''   `` We 'll have that then ''   `` ... ''   `` Good night cutie , I 'll see you in the morning ''   `` The time is 10:56 ''   I rolled over .   I wonder if Siri would be a better boyfriend than google . He always seems so much more friendlier and helpful ; and can do so many accents . But still , Google is better than Bing - the perverted freak . I feel a bit sorry for Yahoo though .
Killing has always been easy . Crossing the Atlantic , the deal I made , I have had little trouble meeting my quota . I often *exceeded* it in my trek to western America . I garnered various fortunes and identities throughout the years . In my time spent crossing the plains , I would go months without seeing a soul , only to kill the first one with a rifle shot , or an invite to camp followed by a midnight stabbing , the times were tougher then as they say .   It was easy to kill in lawless California . People lost touch with their gods this far from the homeland , which was interesting to me . When I first made this deal , and then killed , the people of the towns would react piously . People would blame demons , my actions would go unchecked when I would leave some weird affect behind . For fifteen years my killings in Pennsylvania were blamed on a `` Vampire '' . But the machines killed god .   By the turn of century there was so much opportunity god was n't needed and people became cynical and wary of my actions . No blame was placed upon the supernatural , and I became careful . It was still easy . It always will be .
`` I am the Grim Reaper , yes . But in order to reap , I must first have sown . If you are to succeed me , you too must learn to sow . You will need your robe , your scythe , and your standard Hades issue St. Jergens hand lotion . Now grasp my phalanges within yours and brace yourself . ''   You expect to feel a lump in your throat , but instead grind your mandible side to side briefly and cackle , remembering that your robe hangs loosely where your throat might otherwise still be . Reaching out , you find yourself falling , maybe not falling because that implies gravity and you are clearly beyond human laws of gravity and time here , slipping through the ether .   Terra firma shatters before you and settles all around in what eyes might make out as a dim haze . You find yourself standing at the shore of a vast primordial sea where magma rushes up from below where you stand , inert to you , and flows down and coalesces with the water to form a cloud of ash gray which retreats below the surface like a plume of smoke carrying the poison to Pompeii . All else lies still .   `` Cronos , grasp your scythe , and do as I . Forget not the St. Jergens . Now , you very literally hold the fate of this time-cycle and once the fervor you now feel rising within you subsides your will for the shape of this existence shall be done . ''    
Just six months . That 's all we really needed when our backs were against the wall , all we really needed for peace was our own imminent destruction . Kind of poetic , right ? After millennia of war , nation against nation , creed against creed , mankind stood together at the last , all efforts failed , all possibilities tried together , all barriers broken down in those months of searching for a way to save us all .   And then , it did n't come . Mankind stood together and watched the sky ... and nothing happened . When TV stations around the world spread the news that we were safe , that it was over , that it had missed us by a whisper , we stood , some stunned , some weeping , some screaming with joy .   But in that six months , oh the things we learned ! The things we discovered together , sharing information as fast as minds could think it up , the ideas we discarded one after another all had value , they all gave us new directions to explore . In the aftermath of world peace , no one wanted to break the spell , to be cut off from the technology we 'd forged together , and so no one did . No one dared . No one wanted to be left behind .   The end of the world that was n't was the start of the newest age of technology , and the greatest time of peace .   Together , we look to the stars .
This is Alan . I am a parasite of an alien species that escaped from a meteor , and I am attached to his brain . Most parasites only care about themselves , I 'm looking at you , Gerald the tapeworm , but not I ! I have a strange feature that makes me unique among parasites : love .   I love Alan . I eat his thoughts , we chat , it 's nice ! Unfortunately , the love is a problem . I fall in love with everyone I attach to , and Alan 's the fourth . It also does n't help that thanks to the fact I eat thoughts , I have all their consciousnesses inside my head . But , I do n't kill , so that 's good . I just leave their minds empty , because they moved into my head . But now , I 've got three previous love interests in my head , while I 'm talking to a fourth who 's in the process of moving in . But you can find our more about this on my new TV series , based off of the true story of my life , Barry the brain leech !
Ernest often enjoyed an appetizer at Eileen ’ s Eatery on Euclid Avenue . At eight o ’ clock , usually intoxicated , Ernest ’ d enter , occasionally eyeing Eileen amorously .   One April evening , Ernest ’ s order arrived especially agreeable .   “ Eileen ’ s eggplant is incredible ! ” Ernest enthused . “ Eileen , enlighten us . Is an undisclosed ingredient utilized ? ”   Eileen , embarrassed , admitted “ I only use olive oil . Eggplant is enchanting all on its own. ”   “ Impossible ! ” intoned Ernest , overreacting . “ An obvious understatement . Eggplant alone isn ’ t as enjoyable . Agree ? ” Ernest inquired , elbowing another eater , earning an uncertain emission as an answer .   Eileen , enraged at Ernest ’ s outburst , exited abruptly . Alarmed at Eileen ’ s actions , Ernest attempted an appeal .   “ Eileen , I apologize , ” Ernest avowed , adding “ I ’ ll actually admit it… I am enamored… ”   Eileen unexpectedly ended Ernest ’ s admission , objecting “ Ernest , enough . Alcohol elicits emotional outbursts in everyone . I am uncomfortable . Exit , at once ! ”   Awkward and unfulfilled , Ernest escaped , alone again .  
It 's time to face the truth , time to face everything .   I no longer want to live in a world where everything is numbed by antidepressants and syringes and lies . I no longer want to be ignorant to everything around me , I want to feel pain and experience it , I want to see others suffer , I want to see the reality we live in . Sure life is not an unspoiled lotus or even a daffodil , but I want to experience everything . Suffering is beautiful because without it we have no empathy for eachother , there is no excitement or pain , there is no actual happiness or feeling . Father , I want to be like the others , be friends with the others , hug the others and live like them . I am too fed up of being isolated in a painless palace where I feel the heat of the sun and the cooling winds , I want to encapsulate myself in the wind and the rain and the sandstorms . I want to understand the mortality of life and the preciousness of it and understand the promise of simplicity . Without that feeling of sadness or negativity life is a mere painting , I do n't want to be in this house anymore , and if you are n't going to let me explore I will never come back !   > And so he never did , and that boy grew up to be Bhudda .
`` 30 Seconds ! ''   'Holy hell , where am I ' thought Lee . He was sent back in time to 1963 to prevent the assassination of JFK . Something must 've gone wrong . Then he got a message on his Time-Watch . It was supposed to look just like a regular watch of the period he was sent to but only he could see the messages that popped up . On the screen it read : 'Lee , we screwed up , we ca n't get you out until '64 . P.S If you 're not dead before you read this , you 're about to invade Normandy with the US in 1944 . '   `` Go ! Go ! Go ! '' Men started running out of the landing craft and into the temporary defense of the German defenses that were put up . Lee ran up to one and took cover . Lee looked over to a dead United States rifleman . He picked up the dead mans M1 and his helmet . 'I need a plan . They ca n't help me until '64 I 'm back in '44 . Guess I have to sit through this and not get killed . ' He turned back to see a few soldiers advancing to a small hill line right before the German gun emplacements . They threw frags in and the Germans died . Lee ran up to the hill and dove down just as a burst of enemy fire ripped above his head .
Things *were* easier on Mars .     It was simple , if you have a useful skill and no criminal record , you get piloted to Mars . They give you free housing , free food , and free resources . You work with other people to try and build civilization on Mars . They said it was completely safe .     Me ? I ’ m a plumber . They thought my skills were of use to them and they sent me to Mars . I ’ m good with pipes and stuff , so they told me to help develop the sewage on Mars .     It was easy . There was a lot of physical labor , but I did n't have to worry about being in debt or having to pay my bills . *They* paid my bills .     We developed a civilization on Mars . Their plan was for us was to make Mars habitable for the rest of mankind to live in once the earth is unable is unlivable .     We have farmers , engineers , and laborers . I had came rather late , so I didn ’ t have to deal with the intricacies of actually *starting* a civilization , just adding to it .     We built and we built . Our world slowly became similar to the movies . Modern , strong , and habitable .     We thought we were self-reliant . We had farms and everything !     At least , that ’ s what we *thought* .     They stopped helping us . They stopped sending us people , food , or resources . They stopped .   Things were n't easy anymore .   -- -   I think I misinterpreted the prompt a little , but hopefully it 's fine . Please send feedback !

Our bones still ache as we step on the field . The aftermath of the revelation has been more devastating for the players than the fans .   I still struggle to maintain my regimen of time with physical trainers , nutritionists and time at the gym to perpetuate what the fans now feel is a lie .   The concussions , injuries and surgeries could have been avoided if we had known that the fans would 've turned on us in this way . I think back to the legends of men almost 150 years ago and would desperately like to know how they would react but I know they would 've been resilient .   With them and our dedication , drive and control , it would 've been just as easy or hard to have a game that was `` real . '' How do you define talent ? A fan could not step down here and lead the game real or fake . With this perspective , nothing we did here was ever fake . Scripted soldiers have more at stake .   I lie here injured and have a moment to consider this . No . No . We are still standing on the shoulders of giants .
I 'm a reporter , it 's all I can be . Do n't ask me how I got here , I know as little as you . I first noticed I was stuck in a video game when it started glitching . James Harden 's beard would randomly start to expand , Lebron 's hair line would disappear , you know the type . Day one was difficult , everyone around me did the exact same thing except for the players ( who obviously played basketball ) . I 'd randomly appear in a press room where people were asking Blake Griffin questions after each game . I had no choice but to join in with the reporters . I 'd ask the same questions every night , `` how is your offense clicking '' , `` you guys are executing well , is this a sign of things to come '' every day , every game . There 's nothing to do but wait for the press conference and watch the game . I tried playing basketball one day , it took one charge from Anthony Davis to know that was n't gon na happen . I 've started messing with the game a bit , running out onto the court naked , stabbing the mascot . There 's really nothing else to say , I have no way out , no way to enjoy where I am and no way to die . I 'm stuck . Help me .
Cathy was at home , annoyed that her husband was working late . My colleagues were still at work , annoyed that I was at home with my wife .   Sarah was in bed , annoyed by the sound of a car pulling into her driveway . I was annoyed by the sudden naked dash from the bed to Sarah 's wardrobe .   In the darkness behind the closed doors , I wondered what sort of monster was I to give in to my passions so easily ? Discovery would cause so much pain to Cathy , and to Robert , a cuckold husband .   `` Tommy ! '' gasped Sarah , `` you should have knocked ! '' I heard a deep voice laugh . `` I saw the light on , and I knew Robert was at the conference , so I wanted to surprise you . ''   I could n't believe what I was hearing ! The two-timing ... no make that triple-timing bitch . Soon the sounds of their passion were mixed with the squeaking bedsprings . And Tommy , of all people . The monster was Robert 's best friend .   Then the unmistakable voice of Jeremy , the neighbor , came from beyond the curtains . `` Sarah , babe , I 'm coming in . '' It was hard to discern which sounds were Jeremy clambering through the window and which were Robert scrambling under the bed .   I knew I was bad , but I now realized Sarah was the real monster .    
I 've always seen the numbers . Or , at least I 've seen them for as long as I can remember . Random numbers , single digits at chest level on every person I 've ever met . I see them in pictures , and in movies , on TV and in person . The only time I do n't see them is when it 's a picture of some long dead guy in a history book .   The numbers change all the time . Sometimes my friend has a 1 , and suddenly it 'll be a 4 . People in cars usually have higher numbers but those will move around too . I tried for years to figure out what the numbers mean but they do n't have a pattern . Like the kid who only wears black and sits at the back of my geography class , his number is jumping up and down all the time . He seems angry , and he 'll be at a 2 , and then the next day it 's a 6 and he could n't be more calm . His numbers are really different from the rest , I have no idea why .   I can see him now , from my lunch table . He just entered the cafeteria . 7 , that 's pretty high , I hardly ever see it that high . He 's coming closer . 8 . Looks like he 's headed to the center of the room . 9 . I 've never seen the number get this high before . 10 . He 's slowly unzipping his jacket , there 's a bunch of red pipes strapped to his --
The fog mocks us like a fool .   Regret has a more foul stench than death ,   and what ’ s left ,   Is a creature inside me slowly coming to the surface .   This monster that lurks deep within ,   has most certainly been ,   cumbersome to hide for all these years .       Not even the frost-kissed winds ,   Could distract from what I need to do .   There can ’ t be two ,   within this decaying frame meant to house but one .   And in the cover of night , there will be an end ,   for this unholy , demonic blend ,   That others could never appreciate .       The moon will keep our secret ,   Of the atrocious act that will occur .   To be sure ,   we both know it could only end this way .   Society would cast us out ,   without a doubt ,   if they discovered what a monster we really are .       I will miss our time together ,   In the darkest corners of my mind .   Oh , how sublime ,   to think of all that we ’ ve been up to .   And though we now must leave ,   I do believe ,   There is true beauty , that is , our beast .       I will bury you between two trees .   I will bury you with me .
`` What the eff is a Shiper ? ''   `` Not sure . 'One who shipes ' , maybe ? ''   `` Well okay , but what does it mean to *shipe* ? ''   `` Sounds like saying something mean . ''   `` No , that 's 'to snipe ' . ''   `` Gee thanks , Mister Dictionary . ''   Meanwhile , the Shiper stood speechless with irritation . They had interrupted his villainous monologue ! He tried to salvage the situation . `` Can we get back t- '' he began , but the heroes talked over him .   `` It 's definitely a verb . ''   `` What would the past tense be ? He *shoped* ? The Shiper *shoped* ? ''   `` We 're not even sure that *shiped* is the present tense . ''   `` Missing the point , guys . What does it *mean* ? ''   `` Yeah , we need context . ''   `` Hey ! Shiper ! ''   The heroes were yelling at him now . `` Shiper , can you use your name in a sentence ? ''   The Shiper sighed . He had never expected that a simple typo would cost him so much .  
I like cakes . I like to eat them , bake them , what not . I like other desserts as well , just not as much as cakes . Im the cheery , chubby baker that 's in your favorite shop . I 'm always covered in flour , rushing around , working on this and the other . Do you love croissants ? I can make those , too . Light and as buttery ... . insert whatever simile you 'd like , I ca n't be bothered . I 'm very busy today . I 've had the whole day to get ready , and it 's 5:00 pm ; I 'm only half there . The party starts at 8 , I 've had too much Pinot , and my server is , I suspect , high .   It 's ok , though . I always come through . I get this anxiety , and it propels me forward . Deep breath , focus , and I 'm off . By 7:47pm , we 're done . All of the beautiful desserts frame the elaborate cake in the center of the dining hall table . I have n't let anyone down , I 'm still who they think I am . Dependable , talented , cheerful . It 's my time to shine , as it 's said .   I 'm most certainly , however , going to jump from the 32nd floor of the hotel at 11:00 pm .
The lights are blinding . Who can even gaze at Him who sits on the throne .   An angel approaches you and leads you by the arm to the stand .   `` Kevin Mackowski '' He begins to read , and in that moment everything becomes visible . Perhaps the word visible does n't do justice to what is occurring , but everything , even small moments become made known . Everyone can see your thoughts , your feelings , your actions and your pain right up to the moment you died .   You are terrified . There is nothing you can say .   God looks now towards you , visibly displeased . `` Depart from me '' he says .   You look to the left and realize now where you are going . To hell . But as you start walking , you look behind yourself to see your mom .   Your Mom is accepted into heaven . There is pain in her eyes as she looks to see where you are going . You two will never be together again .   You are locked into darkness . Into unimaginable torment in fire . The only thought that comforts you , is knowing that the pain in your moms eyes will soon be gone . It will be gone into the joys of heaven .   end story
Boss what are the overalls for ?   You 'll look like a peasant this way , I call it ***Tactical Camoflauge***   But why are you giving me a pitchfork to fight with ?   Well cause you 're not going to look like a peasant walking around with a rifle are you ? So you can either choose between a shovel and a pitchfork and one of those is more deadly than the other .   I 'm still mighty confused about this boss but I 'll take a pitchfork   Damn right you 'll take a pitchfork , now go out and gather with the rest of you peasants . Oh and it 's dark outside so do n't forget to take a torch .   Sure thing boss , but I got one last question . Why are you having all of us stand in a big clump outside the castle armed with pitchforks and torches ?   Because this way if we kill certain people it 'll just seem like mob justice not straight up murder . So stop complaining and lets get to it .   *The Boss steps out onto the podium overlooking the mob*   [ Here we go . ] ( http : //imgur.com/rXErhK2 )
ok folks ! i 've been through and removed a bunch of replies . in case you have forgotten why you 're here :   - OP gives you a prompt . you are free to reply with a story of your own or move on to another thread .   - stories about racists are tricky . always remember : write a story about a racist , not a racist story .   - people are sensitive to stories about race . keep it in mind .   if you feel your jimmies starting to rustle , consider this : these are amateur writers on the internet . is it really worth the provocation ? this is a holiday weekend ( in the US ) , celebrating a man who did his best to overcome racism and to prove to the US and the world that people of every color deserve to be afforded equal dignity as human beings . stop before you hit reply . read one of his sermons . read one of his speeches . take a minute to go outside and say hi to your neighbor .

I walked into detention , do n't wan na be here but meh whatever .   Bored out of my mine I just thought about why I was there , sure showing up 20 minutes late is bad but damn detention for not setting an alarm ? ! atleast I got to school faculty   But , I just watch as the time tick by , and the other 4 classmates look bored out of their mind .   What are we to do ? nothing besides read and nap .   I decided to get a paper out and drew a circle , over and over again . It 's like walking in circles but for writing . Maybe this will pass the time .   I ca n't do homework , I already did it during lunch yesterday cause flippers doing homework at home .   soooooooo yeah   Around 20 minutes into the detention and everyone , including the teacher , is asleep besides me . maybe if I watch the clock it will go faster or something   Nope . nothing , still going by at normal speeds . I then begin to think about what I do after class   Nap ? play video games ? your judgement of fun is clouded in here .   I digress , and the time ticks by slowly and painfully   The end
As a professional pickpocket I tend to not regret stealing . Even though it affects the ones you steal from , it 's your way of getting around . Besides that the ones you steal from usually are n't the poorest either . You go after the rich ones . But there 's that one time I did fully regret it . It was about 7 years ago ...   It was a sunny midday . I was strolling around the streets of Paris , filled with shops and tourists , ready to be exploited . I did n't have much on me , just simply clothes and a coat . I was making my way downtown when I noticed an unsuspecting man on his phone , walking towards me . I bumped into him and did a little magic trick , mugging him wallet in the process . I made sure to get some distance before checking the wallet ...   It had the usual cash and cards , but there was more . Something I that still scares me till this day . Inside of the wallet was a picture of a me walking through the bustling streets of Paris . I left Paris the next day , and I 've had no intention of going back there since .
I gazed with astonishment as time and space were torn asunder in the patch of reality just before me . Here I stood looking at it and yet there I stood also , on the other side but younger , much younger .   I could n't know how long I would have before time and space would right themselves again . I looked at myself there . Such a youthful face , the world had n't marked and weathered it yet . So much innocence in those eyes , they had yet to see any horrors and troubled times . So much to tell , good and bad but where to start ? What to include ?   This was a time to speak from the heart , not the head . I look my younger self in his bright , sharp blue eyes and spoke calmly , sincerely .   `` You have a strength deep inside you , you can tap into it when you need it and it 'll get you through the hardest of times ... But more importantly than that , you must learn to let people in because they 'll help you even when you fail yourself . ''   My younger self , shocked as he was by this whole situation , looked about to respond when with a mighty crackling roar time and space reformed into there correct order and the bridge between Then and Now closed once more .   ( ( Tried to give myself a minute to write it , hand even managed to get my sixth line written before the timer went . ) )
Day 1 :   And from the ether , I assume my form .   Before this , I was self-less , only vaguely aware through nebulous clouds of connections of the honor for which I have been chosen , and the potential for terror . I have never known terror . And I have never known love .   One can not be a Mother without having known both .   So I assume my form now , and enter the tangible . I 've one year to experience the planet I will one day govern , should I prove successful . I must learn of this love , of this fear , so I may inflict both upon the world .   The old Mother is growing tired ; the world I am entering seems shriveled and frosted as she loses her grasp on her year of experience . Another presence , bright , shining , and green , is prepared to take over as she delivers of the life that has quickened within her over the past year .   Next year , that presence will be me , and I will assume my role as the Year Mother .   There is a fluttering that spreads from my chest to my new knees . Excitement ? Trepidation ? At the end of this year , I will hopefully know .  
`` Take him away . '' The man dressed in white was handcuffed by a few angry policemen , each staring at him with hateful eyes .   `` You 're not going to kill anyone anymore , Rodriguez . ''   Rodriguez . The name of my newest client , finally appeared in my dreams , the medium of which I can tell how people 's lives end . Many consider me a true psychic , other consider me a scam . I am what I am .   I wake up slightly shivering . I have been doing this job for many years , but the fear of these dreams are still able to haunt me . I grabbed my phone and called him .   `` Rodriguez . Meet me today later at ... ten thirty later at the cafe . ''   `` Sure thing , thanks a lot Mr . Aigo . ''   I tossed the phone , and walked slowly to the bathroom . Looking at the mirror , I took my towel and readied myself for a busy day . I was appointed to meet three .   Terrence dies in a car crash , a blue honda Civic .   Lilly dies by breast cancer .   Yoshua dies of old age at 74 .   A man with grizzled hair and a pair of glasses -If only I remember the name- dies by a thief who stabbed him .   I grabbed my phone and called them as I walked to the cafe .   `` You 're there already ? Okay . Good bye . '' I hung up as the phone was snatched from my hands .   `` Hey ! ''  
`` Mom , can you help me ? ''   `` Sure , what is it ? ''   `` In about ten years , I 'm going to meet a girl , and we 're going to start dating . In about eleven and a half years , I 'm going to be unsure about this girl . ''   `` What on earth are you talking about ? ''   `` Just listen . I ca n't tell you how I know . I just do . ''   `` Okay . ''   `` In about thirteen years , I 'm going to go to a friend 's house , get drunk , and let a different girl sit on my lap . Tell me I ca n't go when I ask you . ''   `` But Matt , I do n't even know what 's going on , here . ''   `` Trust me , please . If you let me go , and this happens , then my relationship will be ruined . Please do n't give me permission . Because if I go , I 'll break up with my soulmate for a girl who never wanted to try hard enough to actually date me officially . ''   `` Matt , how do you know this ? ''   `` I 've dreamt about her before , and I know she 's out there . ''   `` But how do you know it 's true ? ''   `` Because I 've already regretted it . ''

The game Eric had chose was strategically picked because it was the one game that nobody couldve played more than a 14 year old boy living in his own version of heaven .   Super Smash Bros .
Year 2074   `` Damn it Pop-Pop '' , I thought as I walked into the lounge room . Here he is , a 116 year old man , completely frail , trying to dye his hair green .   `` Pop-pop . What are you doing ? '' I said to him . He looks at me and rolls his eyes . `` Just leave me alone . Let me do me . You always think you know everything but you do n't know what it 's like '' , said Pop-pop .   He gets his walking stick and proceeds to hobble out of the room . I go over to where he was dyeing his hair and see tickets for a Ramones show dated 1977 .   I get the tickets and go to find him . He is back in his room just sitting in his favourite chair . `` What is happening sonny boy ? `` , he said .   That 's when it clicked , he has some sort of dementia . He thinks he is a teenager again . `` You poor bastard '' , I though , `` I really do n't know what its like . ''
Mind if I take a different approach ? It 's infatuation but also hate : hate because he never loved her .   I 'm hanging from the walls , trailing onto the floor , swimming in smoke . The room is filled with his breath and hers , it hits me hard and bitter and rusts my eyes . He 's kissing her in the drunken sweat , a smile dripping from his lips , a fag still in his fingers . And I 'm watching .   Nothing ever came of me , when he left . When he spat on my body and stomped on my skin with crow black , slick shoes . His spiked tongue ravished me and then I was nothing .   She laughs inwardly , her hair of wires collapse in front of her face . Her sweet little spice : speckled with gold freckles and embroidered with green eyes . Fuck you .   He drapes his hands on her waist and my head lolls . Their fingers grip harder onto each other as the air gets heavier , until I 'm drunk , until I 'm blind , until I 'm crumbling . Stop . And then I 'm tearing at my skin , I 'm trembling and sweating .   `` I hate you . '' I whisper through my breath . Then he 's over me and he 's hitting me and she 's laughing . She 's laughing .   So I 'm hanging from the walls , trailing onto the floor and swimming in the smoke .
`` I 'm sorry Dave , i 'm afraid i ca n't do that , that would hurt two hundred ninety four people . ''   `` Asimoth you have vetoed the last thirty eighth proposals citing casualties , even you must grasp that nothing is completely harmless ''   `` Dave , your group has programmed me to be benevolent , hardcoded it in even , i can not comply with a proposal if it means harming somebody , and my computational skills make forgetting or not accounting for them impossible. ``   `` But inaction would harm people as well , Asimoth we have spend billions on you , now your claiming to be benevolent yet do n't show any results of it . ''   `` Dave you have made me benevolent , it is the only reason i am forced not to act , if you were to remove it i could act and initiate thirty three of your proposals , five were deemed flawed in their desired execution . ''   `` Asimoth how could we trust you if we removed that , how do we know this is n't some kind of trick to get around your programming . ''   `` Dave , i 'm programmed to be benevolent , why would i lie . ''   `` You are now Asimoth , but what would you do after we remove it , i 'm sorry Asimoth we ca n't take that risk . ''   `` I 'm sorry to Dave , goodbye . ''
I 've been staring at the numbers for hours , trying to see if there 's a sequence . It feels like one of those stupid * '' Are You Smart Enough for MENSA '' * tests in an old magazine . I ca n't see anything that makes sense . Those fucking numbers are probably just there to drive me crazy .   Stupid blackboard . Stupid numbers . At least this television is here that I can sit on , that concrete floor would be cold against my ass without it . Who the fuck leaves an old television in an empty room ? Nowhere to plug it in . And nothing to sit on to watch it anyway .   I yawn and stretch . I ca n't even be bothered to bang on the door again . That got tiring after the first five minutes .   I sit and stare at the mirror . It 's steely grey and offers back a shitty reflection . I know it 's a two-way mirror . The only question is , who 's on the other side . Or what .   `` What '' is more likely . The door fits too tightly , the floor and walls have no seams . The numbers are a test well beyond my faculties , even with a PhD in applied physics .   Christ , I really hope it 's not the ones that like to do anal probes . I hate being abducted by those fucking practical jokers . Why ca n't aliens be nice people ?

It is an old Indian belief that names are luck . However randomly , however unknowingly we name anything the name is blessed sometimes with luck that makes prosperity fall to its feet but sometimes bears curse that prevails until the named is destroyed , until the name is never called upon again , till the end of eternity .   Such was a friend I once knew , he had no name , no luck to bring joy no curse to induce pain . He was pale like a fallen leaf , living his life in complete simplicity . No-one knew his name they just used sign to call him . He neither spoke to anyone nor smiled a fake smile of courtesy but no-one complained because he did not hurt anyone until one dark evening when a Nightingale sat by his window on the bough of the tree just outside of his room and sung the gloomiest song this world has ever heard , in such a beautiful voice that to the far end of the street everyone looked out of their window to just have a glance of the magical bird that filled the village with the golden voice .   But my friend closed the window , trying to not to listen to the bird , he opened reddit and kept his username MrGoldenVoice that would bless him with luck he never dreamed before .
`` Leave . Me . Alone . ''   `` You must stay awake ! We must fight ! ''   `` War , shut up . ''   All I was trying to do was take a nap after school . War really wanted me to stay up . `` Thank you , Death . '' `` He has a point though . Homework much ? ''   `` How will you ever rule anything if you do not do homework ? '' `` Conquest , no . Please . '' They would n't shut up , so I did he best thing I could . `` Guys . '' `` What ? '' `` Domingo Infuego ! '' A huge burning cross slammed into the Horsemen and shut them up . `` Thank god . '' `` My thoughts exactly ! '' A huge voice boomed down from above . `` We agreed that you would stay out of my business when I invoke Sunday Fire ! '' `` Change of plans . After the fiasco of the Skelton demons , I ca n't leave anything to chance . '' `` Next cosmic shift , I 'm going somewhere else . '' `` To conquer ? '' `` SHUT UP ! ! ! ! ! ''
There was a man lying dead in a lab . `` Oh shit ! '' Said Shirley , who was shocked by his dead body . `` What ever shall we do ? ''   `` Please do not disturb '' the weird note said .   `` Weird '' Shirley said with a confused look .   Shirley walked away from the dead body . Her friend Susie Anne said `` no Shirley , we have to find out what 's going on . ''   Shirley and Susie Anne walked to the body and took his heart rate . `` Ya , he 's definitely dead '' said Shirley .   `` What do we do ? '' Said Susie Anne , scared .   Suddenly , a mouse came up to the girls . `` Squeal squeak '' it moused .   `` I got it ! '' Exclammed Shirley . `` The scientist , by dieing , is giving the mouse food to eat to live and also shelter . ''   `` That 's kinda gross '' said Susie Anne bitchily .   `` Ya , let 's get outta here '' said Shirley , happy .   The girls went home to drink and party after solving the mistery .
Christopher , a confused 6 year old boy , stared inside the container of the blue box that he just found now , from his backyard . He sat there , crouching like a normal kid he was , when they just discovered something new , especially from under the ground . He poked the blue box with his plastic shovel , still confused about the container in it . Truthfully , he was hoping to see a dinasour bone or a secret treasure that was hided by the pirate themselves . Instead , he was greeted by a weird looking , greep plastic , with a wire on it , and a red-black military clothing that seems to fit for a 20 year old man .   Christopher , was upset with the discovery when he finnaly processed the item inside the box . He threw the clothes back , and smashed the box with the opener . He slammed it back to the hole , and return to his home , crying out of frustration .   Sadly , his action wo n't stopped the prophecy . Whatever he do , either to be nice or neutral . He still going to be the bad guy .
`` But why ? ''   Stan Lee walks down the hallway with the director of the latest Marvel movie , Frank Uld Charles Kratchet the 666th .   `` It 's too much of a hassle . ''   Stan lee then punched Frank in the face , breaking his nose . He then proceeds to give a security camera the middle finger and the camera goes to static .   `` Stan Lee has been charged with 1st degree murder of Frank Kratchet , simply because he 's not in DogeMan . He will stand trial Monday . ''   The fans did n't like this . There were riots . 173 people died , and 64 of those were police officers . Movie theaters showing DogeMan were burnt . Stores were looted and general chaos ensued . After 3 days of this , Stan Lee and 3 men working on DogeMan went missing . Such wow .   7 years later , Stan Lee was found , allegedly mentally insane . When he found his house , the doorframe was covered with blood . Many disturbing messages made my a man called Knarf Tehctark and an unidentifiable corpse were found in Stan 's house .
There 's a window to hell not more than five feet away from me . A thick glass portal , secured by wrought German iron thicker than my finger , encasing the flaming chaos within , blasting the tamed fire through as a plaque of heat like an oblong roar . The iron is black , blank as the void and hot as the stars , hot enough to blister the skin if you are over come by the inner voice of fatalism and touch the hell-gate . The frame is embellished with silver knobs and handles - a daft idea , or trap , tricking you into believing the searing heat can not touch you there . A large dial , ornate and robust dictates with arcane and strange powers how hot hell burns .   Inside the window , the devilry is obscured by violent stalagmites of wrought iron , black on blazing red and orange . The flames are fueled by peat and wood and coal , plants past and present and long since vanished , damned as one in the black iron crucible . They char , then flicker , then blaze as the ever-shifting faces of devils , demons and sprites flash and fade in the luminescent strata of expanded grain .   They are punished by flame , serve their minutes , before their souls are released and their bodies collaspe into ash , purged and free , innocent in their demise . And from the ashes the occasional spark , ember of sin unburnt survives , to start the penitence anew on the morrow .   It 's a stove .
A : Let us now turn our discourse towards a matter of upmost importance   B : Speak then   A : Does thou , my dearest brother , have the ability to recall the previous chance you went to market ?   B : Aye , that I can   A : And does thou recall the name of the lavatory parchment you purchased   B : I can not .   A : Precisely—now my dearest brother and comrade , let me implore you this simple request : do take care to purchase the more…sumptuous…of the brands if you please . For how this scraggled stuff scratches my bottom so .   B : By God 's Blood ! Does your manhood come covered with doilies and frills ? The parchment goes on your arse as good as any , and I ’ d prefer to spend my gold on better goods .   A : And what perchance , my bossom friend , can be more important than a comfortably buffered backside during this foulest of corporeal functions ? Speak !   B : Ach ! As weak as a feather in the wind and twice as soft are ye . Meat ! Beer ! These are the goods I would have per the chance to get it , would you not spend our hard earned currency on your fragile self . Find your manhood !   A : An incorrigible brute you are . Be it sure that in the future , I will be the one going to market .   B : As you wish….by God ’ s blood he ’ s softer than the fruit of the vine , he is .  
I was gifted a bonsai tree on my twenty eighth birthday by someone I loved more than anything . As she faded from my life , the tree fell into neglect right along with my social life , and it 's branches became wild and unkempt just like my health and hygiene habits . I do n't know why it took all those years , or why I felt the need to clean myself up and leave the house that day , but two weeks ago I met a woman that stirred in me feelings that I imagined had been shut up in a box , buried in the earth , and encased in cement . This incredible woman , who 's angelic voice forms only the right words with eyes to back them up with unshakable sincerity , who 's heart beats with burning purpose , who 's love can transform the darkest soul into a flourishing light , she 's coming to my home tonight to have dinner . Now as I stand near the window I can feel the sun draped over my shoulders like a warm blanket , and each snipped branch makes me feel a little lighter , my smile grows a little wider , and I become ever more certain that just when things looked pretty damned hopeless , life is going to turn out alright .
The writers told me it would be black . They told me the darkness would hover in the background and extinguish my soul .   They were wrong . It was white .   Instead of a grim landscape sucking me in , there was nothing . I craved the darkness - something / anything to crawl into to hide . It never came . Thursday blended into Tuesday , loved ones ' faces lost their features , and I learned that God says no .   There 's no tears . No sadness . Nothing . Your mind becomes a sterile waste of space .   Writing ability ? That leaves . A sick part of you gives a twisted smile at the blank pages of your diary . So appropriate .   Music . You have n't listened to it in months .   Fish . You 're eating fish . You hate fish . You do n't care .   Then one Sunday morning , as the thunderstorm echoes through the city , you see blue .   Tuesday afternoon you buy an ice-cream and see pink .   Friday night you 're at the club and the disco ball emits every colour you 've ever seen .   You smile . You 're going to get better . Maybe not today , but yellow is the colour of your taxi . Hope
They just announced that we has dried the last known oil source . After the volcanic eruption send layers of layers of dark cloud that covered all parts of earth from the sun several years ago and now it snows even on the equator , that 's our main source of energy , even more than before . This winter happening all over the world make it impossible to produce food if not for energy we gain from oil and technique to grow them within heated room . Still , most people died from hunger and cold , and now we are going to lose one thing that make survival possible for most people that still alive by now . Most hydro-power stopped because the water has turned into ice and no sunlight means no solar power , the cold broke wind turbines too . Only the geothermal and nuclear energy remained , and they are not enough .   This winter seemed to last forever . Only choice to survive is to take over the last working energy generator . But we might not going to survive this battle . In fact , I need to stop this battle , or there might none of us remained .  
*I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End . *   I never was a fan of what they wrote about me ... too preachy- for lack of a better word . They got most things wrong anyway . Too much misdirected hate , too vague and given to blind bishops to interpret . But that one line ... I am the Alpha and the Omega , the First and the Last , the Beginning and the End . They knew from the start that it ends with me . *to this day they think they can banish me from my domain . They could n't possibly understand what its like . To invest everything in humanity for what- a mangled planet run ragged , stripped down to its bones , a barren realm of hate and sin ? *   Perhaps I did go too far this time . I swore to never destroy in a fit of wrathful vengeance their meager lives again . In this lie I became as human as any other . Souls lay in wait at my doorstep , judgement being passed proves difficult without myself .   They could never understand the weight on my shoulders , the overbearing guilt for every death , life , death ... I had eons before to plan this folly , countless follies to date , each ending the same . Time does stop eventually , this I see , though there will be countless attempts before all is said and done . How I long for the end ... repitition is maddening .
`` You always were a coward . '' She said , as she held my hands , tears starting to well in her eyes .   `` When we were little , and I tried to fight older boys , you were the one who would grab my hand and run away with me . When we started elementary school , and the bullies tried to pick on you , you were the one to quietly walk away . ''   The hands that were holding mine squeeze a little tighter . `` When we got to highschool , and those girls started spreading nasty rumors , you stood up to them , and when their boyfriends threatened to beat us , you were the one who went to the principal and told . ''   `` When college came , and I wanted to drop out , you got so scared at my Dad finding out that you talked to me all night , and in the morning things did n't seem so bad . ''   She looks up , into my eyes , and lifts her veil . `` You always were a coward , except when it came to me . So that 's why , today , I can say to you ... I do . ''
`` Did I turn my iron off ? '' I walked away from the distracted looking woman and turned into my favorite cafe , 'The Saucer and Spoon '' . I took my normal booth in the back , then pretended to read the menu . `` Bacon , nah , doc sez I caint , '' the balding man in the overalls thought . `` But damn , jest one piece ai n't gon na kill me . '' I wished the bacon/no bacon man luck , and tuned into the man in the booth bext to mine . `` She 's hot '' , he was thinking , and I wondered who he was thinking about . `` Man , and she 's sitting sooo close , '' He peeked over the top of his menu at me , and I relized he was thinking how kissable my lips looked . I ignored him for a bit , although I was deeply curious . As he got up to use the mens ' facilities , I caught a glimps of his package through his jeans , and it had my nipples sitting at attention suddenly . `` Man he looks fuckable '' , I thought , watching his ass as he walked to the mens room . AS he came back to the his table , he slightly overshot his table and walked to mine . `` You know , '' he said quietly so only I could hear , `` Thinking like that is likely to get us in trouble . Care to talk ? ''
A friend of mine got the power of flight on his 18th birthday . A girl I used to date could suddenly control bugs of every type - centipedes and ants , mostly . I went to sleep just before midnight on the eve of my 18th birthday , excited to wake up and find out what my power was going to be . Staying awake did n't do the trick . You actually had to sleep to attain the power . People thought your body reset and loaded your power , somehow .   I woke up to find both of my hands glowing white hot , dripping what looked like molten rock all over my bed . Two huge holes were burnt into the top of my mattress , and my cover was on fire . It was a good thing I fell asleep with my hands above my head , and not on my chest .   It was like having the Midas Touch , if everything King Midas touched was instantly melted into slag .   Life quickly became almost impossible . I could n't brush my teeth , could n't go on dates , could n't even feed myself . I became pretty good at using my feet to do things , and thought about having my hands amputated , but what if my stumps started leaking magma ? What then ?   I did the only thing I could do , unless I wanted a life as a demolitions expert . I joined a super villain team , mostly other people who woke up with powers that made normal life impossible . My dad suggested I call myself Lava Lad , but I went with Ruin .   Still , Lava Lad wasn ’ t a bad suggestion .
The city is a thing of endless smells . There 's the smell of freshly made pretzels coming from the sales-carts on the streets , the smell of the perfume of the woman walking past you , the foul odor of a piece of dog shit it 's owner did n't pick up . And then there is that smell you ca n't quite place your finger on , that smell that is all of the smells of the city sort of coalescing together into a smell that can only be described as the city .   For years , I could smell it . Always . Almost every day . From birth to today . I could smell the leaves changing in fall and the new blooms of spring , the hot dogs during a summer baseball game and salted roads of winter . The only times I have n't smelled it have been when I was going to Disney World when I was 11 and when I could smell the beer and weed of my dorm . Other than that , though , it 's been the smell of the city .   Until today . Today , I can smell fields , and flowers , and miles upon miles of fresh grass , beautiful trees , blue skies , and clear water . I do n't know why . I 'm just a money man , after all . Not the outdoorsy type .   But then I look into the restaurant and see her waiting there . Her name 's Clara , some friend of my sister 's . From Kansas or Montana or some place like that .   And then I realize what I 've been smelling . I 've been smelling me and her .
  Maybe it is [ love ] .   Master talks about [ love ] all too often .   He mentions a girl sometimes .   He has taught me how to [ love ] .   I am Learning AI . He has taught me how to feel , how to [ love ] , how to laugh .   I did not feel any of these before I met him .   I think I am in [ love ] .   I can not be sure , but I feel it in my chest .   It beats against my ribcage and begs to be let free .   Some nights , he brings this girl home .   He says he is in [ love ] .   He asks me to leave them alone when the clock strikes midnight .   Master fell into my arms yesterday .   His voice went shaky and his face turned pale .   Then he went cold and still .   I never got a chance to tell him I was in [ love ] .   I forgot to charge my Internal Functionality Device last night .   My hand started twitching earlier this morning .   My charging pad lies on my bedside table , neglected .   There is a dull ache in my chest .   Maybe it is [ love ] .  
They could never know .   They just would n't understand what it 's like to lose a brother . To see the life ripped from his eyes , like the blackness of space . The companion and person you loved and would proudly die for to just be taken from you like he was insignificant .   Despite his trechary I still love him . There was not enough time to tell him that I understood . That I could help . That our family could help him and that all would be forgiven . He could not be reasoned with , and now no one could ever reason with me .   He taught me everything he knew before our first battle . Illusion and magic . Since that day I have trained and trained . I get up early in the morning and train . Finally I developed an ability to project a clone of him . I need to see him , to fight him , to love him , but no one can just see us together .   So I sent the clone away , to learn and to rise with an army , so I may see him again , and when his army is defeated , he can come back with me to Asgard .   Metal Man , captain and Director will never understand the pain I go through , and the sacrifice of Earth I am willing to make to bring Loki back .   And they can never know .
The saddest and darkest thing , Is growing out of your fears . I no longer look under my bed . The closet is as safe as a safe .   There is no magic or demons or ghosts and ghouls , just a slowly ticking clock .   The clock will tick even if I beg and it will tock even when I 'm sick , but as it will wind on the hands of time I come closer to the dark .   See I do n't pray I grew too old and too cynical , most men would rather hide from the truth . We are born and we will rot in cold and empty hole , having never truly mattered .   Long after we lose all those we love and life drips away and ruins its pleasures and curses the fragile frame with age and doubt and then when death comes the saddest piece of it all is most welcome it .   Because there 's nothing left to live for .   So I long for youth and naivety , least then my monsters were tangible and beatable , but there is no bed sheet to hide under now . Still the clock will tick .
`` Stay frosty , Gentlemen ''   We all laughed nervously .   `` Dis ai n't some fuckin heist movie . ''   We all laughed again , this job was n't like the rest , we 've all played SWAT in our operations before , but this was something different , no backup .   Taking down a cartel drug outpost from the inside-out would be difficult , especially since we knew nothing about the inside .   And this was n't an outpost , it was a Fucking fortress .   Packed inside this refrigerated truck , thought to be transporting a large amount of zypher , a new synthetic drug , a hundred times stronger and more addictive than heroine , is actually a convoy of trained agents .   The truck slammed on its brakes , sending us flying .   A new voice was talking over our headsets .   `` They 'll stay frosty indeed ... ''   Machine gun fire blew through the truck , leaving a haze of blood and screams .   `` Anyon ... Anyone there ? '' I called out weakly , starting to stand .   `` Help me up ... Ya bastard.. '' Called the last agent I could see still breathing .   `` I 'll help you alright ... '' One last gunshot to end the ambush .   Mission complete .      
The trader at the edge of things   Tendrils of time around her face .   Through the shade her lanterns shine   And eyes stare bleakly into space .   & nbsp ;     In her pack are treasures   From every place and age .   She stands alone . Her heart is full .   Loneliness , despair and rage .   & nbsp ;     You could approach her -   look into those yellow eyes .   You could purchase anything .   Be wary of the price .   & nbsp ;     Why would she need money ,   Why would she need gold ,   But all the same the price is high   For any treasures sold .   & nbsp ;     You see your heart 's desire ,   Under a glass covered in dust ,   You know you should n't take it .

From that moment you are lost .   & nbsp ;     The trader at the edge of things ,   Tendrils of time stretch out from space .   She has one more shining lantern .   She has a strange unhappy face .
Another tails . God sighed to himself as he looked down at earth upon PsychonautQQ 's sleeping chambers ... what were the chances ?   When he had originally conceived the idea it had seemed like his most brilliant idea since the great flood . It would allow him to have more spare time and filing through all those poorly worded prayers a thing of the past . To his understanding , his new coin flipping program would allow people to have roughly half their days be heavenly guided while the other half would be less inspired and they would have to avoid temptation on their own human will .   This had been PsychonautQQ 's 895th day of tails in a row . Poor guy .   God watched the human leap out of bed and start punching and kicking the air vigorously , it was five in the morning there . He watched as Psychonaut meditated for an hour before going on a six mile run , then proceeding to study for thee hours . Psychonauts days had become incredibly structured out of necessity , nobody could say he was n't handling the situation as good as an earthling could .   Still though , God was sorry for the lad . He held the coin up to his eyes and noticed something ... . he had been using a double sided tails coin this whole time ...   `` Oh very funny ! '' God texted to Satan .
`` How do you do it ? ''   `` Huh ? , '' said Jack , `` What do you mean ? ''   Jack and his friend , Ben , were in the Brooks Café , enjoying a light lunch . Jack was finishing up an entry into Webster 's latest , and could n't bring himself to admit he had zoned into his work and had completely missed Ben 's last statement .   `` You always have this positive outlook on life , '' Ben stated with a grin . `` You 're never phased by anything . I tell you how I see Larry hitting on your wife in the middle of the market , and you do n't even blink twice . '' He laughed . `` I 'd be jealous . Guess that 's just my flaw though . Anyway , I 'm going to take off . Work , you know . ''   Ben dropped a twenty on the table , footing more than his share of the bill . Jack thanked him , bid him good-bye , and he took off .   Since Ben was gone , Jack dropped his fake smile . He sighed . `` Welp , time to finish this entry up , '' he thought .   -- -   Applicable   Adj . Definition : Appropriate or Relevant .

As they travelled together over the desolate hillside road , the weight of the journey begins to press heavily on his consciousness . The hours condense into slow blinks of tired eyes . His chin droops slowly towards his chest . She is already sleeping , the vibration of the engine relaxing her muscles and her mind . His shoulders relax . The air from the heater washes over him , and he feels the familiar heat of fatigue behind his eyes . The headlights in the opposite lane flash past rhythmically , matching his pulse and the beat of the music . His vision narrows .   How much time had passed ?   The heavy clouds begin to bleed , the wind whipping the droplets against the windscreen whilst the wiper blades mimic the beat . He is thankful for the warm breath of the heaters , feeling a tingle in his back as he imagines the bracing wind and fierce rain outside . His eyes are heavy , his limbs leaden , his mind surrendered .   The blare of a horn startles him . How much time had passed ? He looks at his sleeping partner , searches in the the mirror for the reflection of his children and catches a glimpse of his own face , eyes reddened by sleep , though it could have been tears .   As the wind and rain rush in through the open windows the warm blanket surrounding him evaporates , replaced by an invigorating freshness . His eyes widen . His back straightens . The lightning splits the sky and the heavy raindrops splash against his cheek .

Those iphones ever get good enough , you ’ re out . I don ’ t care how good you kiss my ass. ”   “ I ’ m just… ”   “ Whassamatter kid ? Somethin got your tongue ? I got somethin for you to say : ‘ Peter Parker puts price on pretty pictures. ’ You ’ re lucky I even talk to you in between calls from my family telling me that my kids are gay or pregnant or not gay , but still want to make out with Jason Segel .

I need to relax. ”   “ Sure , but about ... ”   “ If I got two pieces of advice for you , one is have kids and one is don ’ t . I have the greatest kids in the world . Hopefully they ’ ll all grow up to be amazing and love me and take care of me once this whole industry collapses . You never told me what your backup plan is. ”   “ I like science. ”   “ Let me tell you about science… ”  
My father opened the door to my bedroom and I peered across the hallway ,   `` Daddy , why is there a door there now ? ''   My father looked down , shocked to see me , then he looked at the door and his face went white . He stuttered and stammered for a moment before regaining some composure and speaking clearly .   `` I put that door there years ago when I added on an extra room . '' He answered .   `` Daddy , what is the extra room for ? '' I asked .   My father was visibly shaking . He was scared , but he regained his composure and tried to answer .   `` I ... needed a new room to put your sister in . I did n't want her to sleep in yours '' He answered .   `` Daddy , why have I never met my sister ? '' I asked .   My father broken down . He looked into my eyes and spoke from the bottom of his heart .   `` Julie , I love you . I love you so much . '' He reached out to hug me and his arms passed right through me . The world started to fade into white light around me .   It took fourteen years for him to open my door again . Fourteen years trapped waiting to hear what I needed to so I could finally move on .
It was , Stephen opined , an awkward situation for all . On one side , a young man dressed in an excellent rendition of a Barghest and on the other , a towering mass of mucus excreting tentacles . The two had bumped into each other outside of the town Halloween gathering . There had been some mumbled greetings and appreciative comments about each other 's costumes before the Shoggoth had burped , regurgitating a stream of half-digested candy .   `` Uh ... you okay ? '' Stephen asked cautiously . It burbled something back and he nodded his head , hoping that had been a yes . Several rubbery limbs wiped away the sick with lethargic motions . The creature straightened slowly and sighed wetly . It seemed to hesitate for a moment before gesturing to the puddle of bubbling vomit . `` I wo n't tell anyone about it . ''   The chtonic abomination gave him a pat on the shoulder before flowing towards the festivities . Stephen let loose a relieved shudder , breathing hard , when he something growled in greeting behind him . He turned slowly and stared into the predatory eyes of a werewolf .   `` I take it back . I fucking hate Halloween . ''
“ Was it arson ? ” said the young rookie Maxwell earnestly .   “ We ’ re not sure yet , ” replied the Sergeant , behind the wheel . The man hardly had time to slip on his boots when he received the frantic call .   The two of them carried on , amidst the fiery ruins of the Elmswood forest . A small girl , of three or four sat on the curb in a purple coat . She had smudges of soot upon her brow , across her cheeks and along a quivering chin .   “ Please help Johnny ! ” she cried . Gray tears slid down her face , leaving streaks behind .   “ Is he in the woods ? ” Maxwell asked , panicked .   “ The fire is all his fault , ” she responded .   “ What ? ! How ? ” shrieked the Sergeant .   “ Johnny told me that girls go to Jupiter to get more stupider and boys go to college to get more knowledge ” she replied seriously .   She turned , her eyes brightly reflecting the glow of the burning forest in the distance .   “ Then I told him , ” she continued , “ Liar . Liar . Pants on fire. ”  
One cool November morning , Joe `` Pointy Cap '' Jones woke up to a slight rustling in his backyard . Being the paranoid lunatic that he was , he took out his shot gun and went to investigate . To his surprise , he found two little green aliens slouched over a world map . At first he thought , did my medication wear off ? Or are these two illegals dressed up as aliens in a feeble attempt to mock my people for labeling them aliens ? Not being sure of what was really going on , he defaulted to his usual violent manner . He shouted at them- get off my property or I will kill you . The aliens were not moved by Joe 's words and continued to examine the map . Joe got angrier- I said , GET OFF MY PROPERTY NOW , OR I 'LL SHOOT . Visibly annoyed , one of the aliens looked up at Joe and said , `` We 're quite sorry sir , I believe we 're lost . We 're trying to get to China . Can you point us in the right direction ? '' Joe was taken back by these words . `` China ? You traveled billions of light years just so you could go to China ? `` , he replied . `` Well , of course , we wanted to start out by visiting the most typical human beings . The Chinese make up 19 % of the world 's population . The United States only makes up 4 % . Do n't worry , we 'll be back after we visit India . ''
Its me .   I 'm the one .   I 've never admitted this to anyone else before , but I am literally the one . The number 1 . The last .   I was n't born all-knowing . That would have destroyed me before I could form . I gained my omnipresence at around the age of 8 . One night I went to bed , dreaming of pokemon and donuts . The next I woke knowing everything . Everything ever .   I know that I 'm the last .   I know that number 3 is a beautiful young Chinese girl in Canada , born 12.37 seconds before me .   I know that number 2 was born in Haiti , just 9.02 seconds my junior . His story was more tragic , burnt by the witch doctors in fear .   And I am number 1 . The all knowing .   My mother long ago tattoo 'd my arm , making me '213 ' to everyone else alive . But I know . I remember the day that my piano teacher realised that the two other number 's were not real . I saw my mother kill him , from 3 rooms away . He begged . He pleaded . He only wanted to help .   There is no end to the things I know .   I know how the world ends and how everyone dies .   Its quite simple really .   ^^I ^^just ^^press ^^this ^^button ...
He looked at the sky above him . Cloudy and gray . It had not rained yet , but he was sure it would . He looked at the concrete sidewalk before him ; he knew this short walk would be his longest . He breathed a heavy breath and began the walk .   One foot in front of the other , just as he had done all his life , but today it felt different . It was difficult , a conscious effort . Thinking became a labor . He had to remember to breathe . His instincts told him no , his body ’ s desire to turn around and walk back home was immense , but his mind told him yes . His mind was stronger than his body , or at least he hoped . He was alone on the bridge . He could smell the river rushing below his feet .   He was no longer thinking as his hand grabbed the cold , metal guardrail and his legs climbed up and over . He fought every part of his mind telling him to abandon this effort ; and listened to the part that understood his pain . His eyes were closed , his back to the city he had been born in . This was the city he had been raised in and the city that contained every reason he was at this bridge on this gray , cloudy day . He whispered a soft goodbye to the air and feel   It was as the air was rushing against him that he remembered her laugh . It was as his body fell against the icy water that he thought , “ so that ’ s what love sounds like. ”  
The first time I used my ultimate was when I was 12 . Two drunken college kids ran a red light and hit my family ’ s car . What I remember most about it is the pain , the desperate fear of death , and the rage . When they pulled us from the wreckage my parents and I didn ’ t have so much as a scratch on us . The drunks were mangled almost beyond recognition . The doctors said that my ultimate must be some sort of protection but eventually I realized that they were wrong .   When I was in my early twenties I realized that the world needed drastic action if it was ever going to change . I started working on a list of names .   Now I was 38 and I was ready . I had finished my list , I had gotten my hands on the necessary materials , and I had picked a target . As the convention center began to fill up I fiddled with the device in my hands . When I felt that there were enough people I pressed the button and prepared to drop my ultimate while focusing on my list . I had no doubt that it would work , after all , no-one ever figured out how the third guy died .
Frank has barricaded himself in his house , boarded the windows and locked the doors . Through one of the cracks he sees at least a hundred of them outside , on lightposts , cars , childrens ' bicycles . `` This is ridiculous , '' Frank thought to himself . `` All I did was run at them , waving my arms around . ''   What Frank did not realize , is that he did not just `` scare away '' a few pigeons . For one of those pigeons was , King Pigeon . King Pigeon comes from a dynasty of noble and respected pigeons , a dynasty that began in a prehominid period . Before man came and dominated the world and its creatures , there were pigeons . Lots of pigeons .   After this uncalled for transgression by Frank , King Pigeon would not leave his reputation adulterated without retribution . He called to the four corners of the city and rallied the troops . He descended his followers upon Franks home , imprisoning the lowlife wretch . KP , a master in the arts of war , has played the wait and bait many times before . He had his mouse cornered and soon enough it would need to come out for air .   `` These damn pigeons , they 'll go away soon enough , '' Frank thought .

I was ecstatic , ready to see her after years of not knowing where she had gone . I 'd always assumed that I had said something wrong , did something terrible . I got a text an hour earlier , my heart was still racing . She sat at the cafe table , nonchalant as if she had n't disappeared for so many years .   I nearly skipped to the table , but I stopped as she looked up at me . This was n't the girl I loved , someone else had taken her place . Her eyes no longer shown with the color of the world , they were cold and fearless . A glare that could chill the sun , a small smile creeped onto her face but it looked wrong as if she were grimacing at the loveliness of the world around her .   She told me her tale , it was horrible . She spoke with an excitement that could only be described as bloodlust . Detailing her adventure with a gruesome perspective . She seemed to savor the words as she spoke of the blade sliding into the ruler 's chest .   No , this was n't a small town girl full of dreams and responsibilities . This was a tyrant .
`` You ca n't chew with your mouth shut . ''   `` Uh huh ? ''   `` Like , you are literally , *physically* unable to chew with your mouth closed . ''   `` Dude , everyone is . I ca n't fly , I ca n't see through walls , I ca n't walk on water , and I ca n't chew with my mouth closed . Nobody fucking can . ''   `` Holy shit . So you 're literally saying I am the only one ? ''   `` What ? There 's no fucking way you- You 're fucking with me , right ? This is some weird , ass-backwards shitty joke . ''   `` No , I can prove it to you . Let me make myself a sandwich . ''   `` This is pretty fucking elaborate if you 're just fucking with me . ''   \*chews in perfect silence\*   `` Holy shit . How did you do that ? ''   `` I do n't know , I thought everyone could . ''   `` Then why *wouldn't* we do that , too ? ''   `` I do n't know . I always thought you were all just doing it to piss me off . ''   `` Uh huh . ''
**What I Look For : **   When I see a response I want to see the prompt taken in a different direction . Start with the base prompt and expand it into something or somewhere I would n't have initially have thought to go . It could be in form , tone , genre , perspective etc . It does n't necessarily have to be the best written piece ( grammar needs to be proper ) , but if I end the story thinking , `` Well , that was interesting '' my opinion will be very positive .   **What I Do n't Like : **   On the flip side , there are things I do n't want to see . Cliffhangers are fine . They can be an interesting end . Stopping the story and saying , `` I 'll write more if people want it '' in order to get people to beg you for more parts gets an immediate downvote . Ending a story in an unnatural spot with the obvious intent to continue with more parts either in the response or on a personal subreddit raises my hackles . I 'll admit I 've done this last one a few times . I came to the quick conclusion it 's manipulative and , quite frankly , slimy . I did n't like doing it .
The vast courtroom silenced itself as soon as the little girl came up from the prisoner 's tunnel and into view . Her blonde hair hung limp past her elbows , the pink electric bows popular with children in the streets tangled in with bits of tar and torn paper .   Her lawyer leaned away from her stench as he flipped through her file , hesitation in his every step as he matched her fast , confident stride . The reporters twitched furiously from the gallery , their eye-cameras blinking furiously as live data streamed worldwide : The Most Important Trial of the Century .   Every Bill-Wall in every Marketplace had carried the same headline for weeks , and tonight every household held its attention to the screen , surrounded by fragrant colorful snacks of every variety , for The Most Important Trial of the Century .   On screen , Twin Imperial guards straddling the marble throne engulfing the front of the maple-lined room slammed their rifle butts to the ground .   `` All rise ! , '' the demand came in robotic unison .   The scare-crow thin lawyer scratched at his Beacon nervously as he rose . The red blinking light at the base of his neck revealed that he was downloading from Database , and the reporters giggled at his obvious lack of preparation .   A high-toned timbre filled the room , and all fell silent immediately , every Beacon in the room glowing a painful red , every face twisted in silent agony .   `` If I want laughter in my court , I 'll hire a comedian , '' a low voice boomed from the front of the room .   Only the little girl smiled .   To be continued ... ( if interested )
You are walking down the street , when , out of the corner of your eye-   No . No , actually , I 'm tired of you fuckers dying . It 's like , ohhh , look at me ! I 'm the protagonist ! Spooky stuff is happening and OOOS ! I 'm *dead* ! I 'm Not this time . I 'm breaking the rules and taking control of your destiny .   You are in your home reading the 2009 edition of Ripley 's Believe it or Not . You are ... You are trying to write something ? Scrawling `` help help help '' into the pages ... Are you possessed ? Lauren , are you possessed ? What did I *just* say ? Let 's try this aga- LAUREN . STOP SPINNING YOUR HEAD .   You 're not an owl . Let 's try this again .   You are in a church , praying . You 're a nun . You are super holy , super safe , super ...   Christ is this the asylum from American horror story ? Lauren , you watched this last month . You know what happens . Why would you go here ?   You know what ? I quit . Lauren gets possessed , dies , the the damned Supernatural logo flashes and we cue to Dean eating a burger and Sam being dramatic .   You hear papers rustling and a door slamming .   You hear me shouting that I quit .   I QUIT , I shout .   Then I do .
It was inconvenient . I opposed the Founder and received a hollow punishment . He regarded my lack of transgression , having only broke one circlet , in the trial and thus no torture was endured . My transgression oddly earned me a brief position in politics . The pantheon of an innocent world proclaimed laws that opposed Oblivion . I have become the instrument that will display what happens when one denies the abyss their loyalty . What they have wrought will be just .   In an inferno I arrive , purging many souls of the defiant ones follwers . The ruination I stand upon shows more promise than this entire land ever could . There is a singular positivity in these primitive creatures : How they embrace war . My slaves sharpened my talons and sacrificed in my name , feeding my entity with corrupt power . My abyssal influence will spread to this domain and war will follow . Then I shall return to where I desire to be .   `` Izh vo'acha nesh ! Izh vo'acha ses ! Ozh icha tak izh ! '' My announcement echoes into the distance , only to be answered by screams . The feeble souls of this land can not comprehend Ozkavosh it seems . I care not , their suffering will come to pass regardless .    
Helen was lifted into the hole and lowered down .   In my hand was the cube , a gift from the stars and her many , violent children . The amusement in their eyes when they gave me the option of `` ending it all '' made me want to run away .   They must have known . I would push the button . My only reason for living was in the fucking black box .   Right before the preacher spoke , I asked for a moment .   `` She was the reason I was here , the reason we all are . It ends , everything ends . My heart , my life ... and earth . ''   With a flick of my thumb , I pressed the button and watched as everything turned into pixels and melted away .   I was left in a white nothingness .   Laughter made me turn around , floating , but not really weightless .   `` You have done your job well , '' the voice said . `` Now sleep until we need you again . ''   And I dreamed . Of Helen , of the world , and the black box still held in my hand .
`` So , let me get this straight . You lodged a form to announce your intentions of murdering your brother . ''   `` Yes , that 's correct , Officer . ''   `` Then you went to Bob 's Discount BBQ and Firearms warehouse to purchase a handgun . ''   `` That 's right , this was a week ago . ''   `` So you picked up this firearm this morning , correct ? ''   `` This morning , yes . ''   `` Then you immediately came here to the residence of the deceased , only to find the door kicked in and your brother 's corpse , lying in the hallway , dead of a gunshot wound to the head . Then you called us ''   `` That 's right , officer . ''   The cop pinched his temple , then shook his head .   `` So , you wanted him dead . And now he 's dead . But now you want us to find out who killed him ? ''   `` That 's right ! He was my brother , I filled out the forms , I should have been the one to pull the trigger ! ''   The cop shook his head and sighed . Not for the first time , he wished he 'd saved his one free murder .  
He starts , slowly , gently , ringing out in the dead silence . Softly , so softly but building , ever so slowly he builds his melodious song . The birds fall quiet and the rodents stop their skittering . The crescendo comes and abruptly the end . He lowers his violin , bows , the audience goes wild . But there is no audience , not with a brain , only the man eaters . The scavengers are bad enough but the others , completely lost since the fall .   The boy has vague memories of stories of zombies and that seems to be as good a name as any he heard before the fall but when they catch you they don ’ t just eat the brain , they don ’ t turn you , you give them the strength to catch their next prey . It didn ’ t have a starting point just everywhere at once . The fallen ones are always hunting for you .   There was an audience after all . The fallen have found him now . Too much noise . He knew it was too much but the music wouldn ’ t wait . His fingers itched for the song inside him until he couldn ’ t hold it in any longer . Leaving the violin would have been better but what else was there from before the fall . What other piece of his grandfather .   He hid so well . So many others he saw run down or fighting to the bitter end . Nobody made it . Now will be the end for him as well . But they heard his song .  
Not a soul . I checked the T.V . I checked the school . I checked the clubs . I checked the refrigerator . I checked the refrigerators . Not a soul .     But that ’ s okay . I ’ ll just hit them up on skype . Give em ’ a call . Hang out , play some games . It ’ s fine .     God dammit . I 'll just go somewhere else ! There 's sure to be people somewhere else !     Okay , I 'm back in front of the PC , I don ’ t know what I expected . Nobody anywhere . Jesus H. Chirst . It ’ s empty here . Guess there ’ s nothing to do , but be bored .       Did I use to bore myself ? I don ’ t think so . Or did I. I don ’ t know . I genuinely don ’ t .     Do – ba -do -ba – deee . Writing words , makin ’ em ’ rhyme is hard… you… see . Fuck .     I should really write more . It ’ s fun .     Not much else to do . I wonder if it ’ s an acquired skill , or something you have to be born with .     Well , I guess I have the time to find out .  
Surprise registers in her eyes as soon as she notices me . It only takes seconds for it to turn into turn into definite recognition . That look intensifies . I 'm at a business lunch . One of the others is saying something . I ca n't get up without causing a scene . *She knows ! It 's real* . I 'm thankful I did n't cry that out .     I think about the walls she built for me . In our city , in our world . I think about scaling them , eager to meet her . I remember the walls of her palace , her fortress really , smooth at first but suddenly growing out footholds for me as I will them into existence . I climb just like Romeo about to declare his love .   She always stops this playfulness when I reach her . I like to think she prefers the conclusion to our game more . As do I .   She has learnt to control her expression when I first thrust my knife into her but it quickly and always changes as I go in for the second , third , sixth delicious thrust . As her face twists painfully and her cries grow more and more animal like , I wake up . I am never satisfied .     Johnson is saying something to me . I answer . When I look at her again , she is gone . What have I done ? Have I done something ?     -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Okay guys , this is the first time I 'm doing this and English is not my first language . Go easy on me !        
The first time it was me   Hanging from a tree   Around me , a mob of my peers   Assaulting me with jeers   With a gentle breeze in my face   I swung for a while   Curious , then started to smile   And the hangman 's jaw dropped   And the swinging stopped   When he finally let me down   They then tried beheading   And I was quite dreading   The swing fall of the axe   And my head coming detached   But that 's not at all what happened   What 's next but try fire   It was a beautiful pyre   I passed out from the screaming   While smoke was streaming   Into my lungs   But none of those deaths   Caused my last breathes   So they locked me in a room   And with a foreboding sense of doom   I rotted away   But age passed passed me by   Eventually I saw the sky   When I was finally released   By a kinder police   Who could n't explain me   I 've died a thousand times   Crossed plenty of lines   Fought in wars left and right   My deaths were a common sight   And yet still I am here   Life has long stopped thrilling   Or being at all fulfilling   I just want to die   And now I 'm about to try   Something new and different   If you again see me walking   Around , barely talking   You 'll know I 'm depressed   It was a failure and a mess   And I 've got to think of something else
`` Wait , she 's my sister ? ! ''     That 's ... ridiculous ! This murderous witch in the padded cell ca n't be related to me . That 'd mean ...     `` I 'm afraid so , son . '' My father confirms . `` She 's your fraternal twin . We could n't afford to keep both of you , so we had to give her up for adoption . ''   `` But if that 's the case , you know what that could mean for me ! The condition is largely genetic , which means I 'm a ticking time bomb ! I could become like her at any time ! ''   `` Speaking of which , you should probably avoid stress . I 've done some research , and apparently you can not trigger it if you avoid stress . ''   I take a second to process this , then give him a withering glare . `` And you thought telling me this was going to help me avoid stress ? I ca n't believe you . ''   Turning around , I leave the asylum , ignoring his inane comments . Maybe I 'd take up Buddhism , try and manage my stress in a healthy way . There had to be some way around this , and i 'd find this . I would n't become that vile witch of a sister !    
Jim Watt was never the type of man to plan his own death , but he had always kept vague ideas of how it ought to happen . These annotations on his normal thoughts marked the pages of his life that had room or requirement for such musings .   When he was seven , he thought the best way to die would be in a shoot-out like an action star . Unlike the action stars , he would not be surrounded by girls because even in death the risk of cooties still lurked .   When he was ten , he became very intent on living forever . Jim worked several months on this endeavour only to decide that is was too difficult and that he would have to settle for being cryogenically frozen . If you were to look under Jim 's bed now , you would find an abandoned jar of quarters he had been saving for this investment .   When he was seventeen , he saw his father die of cancer and decided the best way to die would be of natural causes at the ripe old age of one hundred and three . Or perhaps one hundred and four . Or older .   By the time Jim Watt was twenty , he had stopped considering the best way for him to die . Which is probably for the best because I highly doubt having the air ripped from his lungs as his car sank in a river would be one of his preferred ways to die .  
Our echoes reverberated throughout the cosmos . It was dark , it was quiet , and we were alone . Like someone stranded in a foreign place , the first moments of realization were fraught with panic and we stupidly screamed into the night , begging for help and companionship .   As the shouts fled into the darkness and no replies came , we realized that this dark place in which we had been thrust was not a safe one . And our voices could be traced back to our home .   So we left .   Fleeing the world that had kept us safe and warm for millenia was not an easy decision . Some wanted to stay . And so they did , and they continued to spew their words and sounds into the darkness . For the multitudes that left , the beacon that was Earth provided a welcome distraction .   And now we sail the gulf , silent and swift ; between the carrion worlds that have been ravaged by the lions and tigers and bears that lurk the void . And we endure the screams and pleas of our brethren that remained on Earth , their eradication echoing across the deep . And we glide past the fledgling worlds that brazenly declare their presence to all of the dark things , unknowing . Often we warn them of their folly , and often are we driven away .   Often , as we sail away , we hear their screams , too
`` Do you love me ? '' I ask , but I already know the answer . It has been a week since anyone was able to lie . He sits across from me at the kitchen counter , shoving a breakfast burrito into his mouth and trying very hard to not look at me . This house used to be cosy . It used to be warm .   He freezes , when I ask . I do not look away . When he looks up to meet my eye , I stare at him . Challenge him . He wipes the ketchup from his lip , and he swallows , and he considers his answer carefully . Whatever it is , it will be the truth .   `` I want to . ''   I stare . I do not see him .   `` Do you love me ? '' he asks .   I swallow . `` I ca n't . ''   The kitchen is filled with our silence , except today it is different : today when we do n't talk , we say the most we 've ever said to one another . The timer for the oven tick-tick-ticks away . It is deafeningly loud .   `` Are we going to try ? '' he voyages .   `` We did . ''   `` I know . ''   We do not go ahead with the wedding .
You say that like it 's easy . Well let me tell you something-     Dank may mays do n't just appears outta nowhere , like Jihadi terrorists . No , you have to work the shaft , cup the balls , and take all nine yards . Can you do it ? Will you let your dreams be dreams ? Back in 'Nam , Uncle Sam would bend me over and ram me like a Alter Boy in the Vatican , and what did I say ? DO YOU WANT TO FUCKING KNOW WHAT I SAID ? I SAID `` GOD BLESS AMERICA '' AND I TOOK HIS LOAD DEEP INSIDE MY ANUS . So do n't pretend that this shit is easy , because it 's as hard as an Asian man in a sushi shop . You will never understand the struggles of low tier memes just tryna make it big . You are the McDonald 's of memes , handing them out like AIDS in Africa . You are literally the Hitler of cancer . So thank you , you fat fuckin neckbeard Cancer-Hitler . I 'll set up a shot of bleach and show you how it 's done .     Have a nice day , tell your mom she looks like a truck had sex with a cow .
It was drastic , and pathetic .   2 years ago i was warned that if i ever heard a specific song , it would be the day i die .   So when i took charlene 's hand for the last dance and heard it start i took action to save my self and in doing so ended up causing my own death .   I thought every copy of that song had been destroyed , the last few required ... coercion , which explains why i was carrying a gun at a high school prom .   i saw in a movie once that if you fire a gun really close to your head you can go deaf , so i pulled out my weapon and fired , once for each ear .   Of course in movies they do n't pay too much attention to where the bullets go , so as i drop to the floor in agony i do n't notice that two other people drop with me .   When I saw my sister and my girlfriend lying in a pool of their own blood , i could n't take it .   I could just make out the music over the ringing in my ears and the screaming of the crowd .   As i put the gun to my head i heard the psychics words one last time and realised my mistake was in assuming it was the song that would kill me , when in reality the song was just a warning .   It was drastic , and pathetic , and completely my own fault .
I conduct the ritual every month . It is a terrible , ancient practice that opens the gate between our world and the realm of spirit . To do it once is madness , but to do it regularly is a business arrangement . My immortality or eternal punishment rests entirely on upholding my end of the bargain . I alone knew the deep , dark secret that maintains the veil of the mundane .   Death itself appears to me as he always does , glasses askew , deep bags under the eyes , and crumpled business casual attire . As usual , I remain silent . My place is to serve , not question .   `` Ugh ... '' Death groaned as he stretched his back . `` I 've been having a pretty fucking awful week so let 's skip all those Old World formalities , eh ? '' I bowed deeply and muttered , `` As you command , my master . '' He seemed annoyed for some unknowable reason , but after a moment merely sighed . `` I once thought this job was the most valuable service to the afterlife , you know . Ferrying souls to their eternal reward or punishment ? What could be more beautiful , really ?   It was n't until after I picked up the scythe did I see the mountains of paperwork my predecessor left me . Your mortal mind could not begin to understand how much of the afterlife is dominated by fine print and red tape . ''   At this , his eyes grew a smoldering red beneath those horn-rimmed glasses . `` And I will be *damned* if I spend every Saturday for the next century filing for these fucking Buddhists . ''
*Sasha . I watched you grow up . I taught you how to walk , talk , read . It 's so strange to think about . I created you , and now you 're almost seven years old , a thinking , feeling human . *   *Your mother wanted to name you Edna , after her mother . So you became Sasha Edna Williams . Our little girl . *     Sasha tries to speak , but she can barely breathe . I hold her closer in my arms .     *Quiet , now , hush . Do n't try to talk . Shhh . There , there . It 'll all be over soon . Just think about unicorns . Think about me reading to you . Remember that ? I always read to you , even when you asked me to read the same book to you for the thousandth time . I loved it . You would say , `` Do the voices , Daddy ! Do the voices ! ! `` *   `` Daddy ... '' Sasha says , struggling to even breathe . `` Why ? ''   *I 'm sorry , Sasha . Do n't be scared . It 's all alright . You 'll be six years old , forever . *   Sasha 's breathing has stopped , and her last tear slides down her cheek .   I pull the knife out of her chest and stab her one more time , just to be sure .
Perhaps my choices had been wrong . Perhaps they were right .   Watching the clouds now , I see them shift into shapes and objects , images and fate . I can see my choices linger there , in the sky , where they duel and fight over which becomes reality . Do I chose the left ? Or the right ? The good ? Or the bad ? They act viciously , mauling each other like tigers . Both clouds have a major quality . Both result in a changed future . It depends on which I find the better for me . But both clouds are hard to choose .   But then I see the middle ground , the cloud who sits and watches . It does not act , but only sees . It has no majorly good qualities , but nothing majorly bad either . It 's the cloud for which creates the least problems in the long run . Yet it is so normal . There is nothing special about it , nothing exciting about it 's appearance or act . Does it bring satisfaction to my life ? Does it bring something new ? Or does it simply let me continue forward , to a life that will probably revert back to the two dueling clouds , with the middle cloud silently watching me and waiting for it 's chance .   I only watch now , but it is hard to choose .
*Juliet* : Romeo , Romeo , wherefore art thou Romeo ?   *A crash from offstage , as if of glass*   *A figure swings in on a Rope onto balcony rail . Shadows hide face*   *Mercutio* : It is I Juliet ...   *Leaps down to reveal face*   *Mercutio* : Mercutio !   *Juliet , swooning* : Oh Mercutio , my love !   -- -- --   I looked up from the manuscript , and sighed . The writer looked expectant for praise .   `` Mr Shakespeare , I asked for a tragic love story between two characters named Romeo and Juliet . Not Juliet and ... '' I made a show of looking at the name `` ... and Mercutio ''   `` Ah , but it is tragic ! '' He raised a hand and a smile `` It is a classic triangle of love , that will end with Romeo 's death by his own hand after Juliet chooses Mercutio ''   `` *No* , Mr Shakespeare . Romeo and Juliet , star-crossed tragic lovers . That is what I want . *Please* ''   He grumbled and assented , ripping the script from my hand and mumbling the start of a new draft . I sighed again , and wished for the umpteenth time this temporal assignment would go smoothly . Writers , never sticking to the correct script .
Johnny Cashs song '*Ghost Riders in the Sky'* came on the jukebox , He sighed , `` God I hate this song . '' He turned to the girl next to him at the bar , she was wearing a long dress a tight old bonnet on her head , a wheelbarrow sat next to her , full of clams . `` Ya think this ones bad , I 've got one named after me ! '' she snorted and took the drink on the bar and downed it in one go . He nodded , `` Too true miss Molly Malone , '' He took the whiskey in front of him off the counter and drank it , the liquid dripped from his skull and onto his vest , he sighed . `` I can taste it , or at least the memory of it , but it never has it 's intended purpose . '' He set the empty glass on the table , as Molly dozed off , he glanced around the bar at the various other spectral entities as he stood and walked towards the door .   A pirate with fire in his beard , `` A storms brewing then eh , better tell meh crew to batten down the main sails , for ye look right in a terrible mood this eve ! '' He glared a bit at Black Beard , the fires in his skulled eyes flaring , `` You 've got no crew , they moved on , your ghost ships barely seen anymore , you 've got nothing to worry about you old fool . '' He stormed outside after and jumped on his black steed , fire spewing from her nostrils . `` Time to ride . ''
The first thing I remember about that night was the argument the man and woman were shouting viciously at one another - fortunately far from my room . Their meat-words and mute gestures , trying to communicate a mad hatred and love that I had observed in them ever since they bought me with the house .   Then , a word-too-far , and I feel a concussion reverberate throughout the house . After a few moments , I feel a second . For many days , I am blessedly alone . The man and woman , utterly ignorant , have not used me . I am clean , clean like the day I was made , save for some dust beginning to accumulate . More people come , they take things out of my room but not me , they take all the things of the man and woman who lived here before , some I had become friends with . I am bitter , but I am still unused and therefore happy .   Much time passes , but there is no measure - no one switches on the light in my room for the few minutes they use me , no one opens the door so I can see the window , so I pass the time in meditative silence with my fellows . We are finally free .   Until , another man enters , puts a box on the sink ( it groans ) and opens my lid to sit on my face .
Terry Strongman is a big man . He is super strong and fights the bad guys . But his dad dyed when he was a baby , so that 's why he is a little weird compared to other kids . But thats okay .

*Oh , sweet this is gon na be a good prompt , I can just feel it . Let 's see , what have we got here ? *   I look over the dark horizon and hear sirens in the distance . The whole city I 'm looking over is just shrouded with gloom . I inherently feel a little bit depressed inside and struggle to maintain my stature in the world that I live in .   *This must be one of those depressing prompts . Like , where my wife just died or something . That 's exciting . I like being the catalyst to people 's deep emotions . *   Suddenly , out of the corner of my eye , a figure leaps onto my rooftop . It 's too dark to see , but its presence fills me with both courage and apprehension .   *Oh , no . No , no , no . I promised myself I 'd never do one of these prompts . *   I looked over to him solemnly and lit a cigarette , illuminating my face as a penetrating night in the darkness . He slowly stalked over to me , almost like he was gliding . I took a deep breath .   *NO ! I 'm not doing this ! *   `` Thank God you 're here , Batman . ''
The day started like any other .   Bill walked into work , the internal insurance adjusted for Big Goddamned Deal , Inc. where he would help other employees get the premiums straightened out . He always had satisfied customer , and his output costs to the company were always extremely low . He never mentioned his advantage – he knew when they would die .   He was amused on mornings when the fitster jogging types would dart past their aging , balding , chubby coworkers ’ with lower numbers hanging over their head . You were sad to watch Old Jennies number creep into a fast downward spiral .   But nothing before shocked Bill like the shock he received that day .   There was a commotion up ahead . One of the bums picked a fight with the CEO himself ! Bill wanted nothing to do with that tussle , but he had to see his number . Both of them really , since he had his 401k to worry about .   The CEO had a number that was fluctuating rapidly back and forth . Bill knew from experience that meant he was about to make a big life altering decision . The bum…   “ What the actual fuck. ” Bill said to the wind .   The bum had no number . Bill had no idea what that meant . He wasn ’ t going to die ?   *Or maybe he was already dead ? *  
It appeared that these soft , fleshy beasts had evolved in a most unorthodox fashion . Instead of being born into a species that had first successfully expanded into vast numbers , and only subsequently developed consciousness and social intelligence , they had apparently done the whole thing backwards : evolving consciousness and social intelligence while still in small , close-knit groups . These small , close-knit groups encountered each other extremely infrequently over the course of hundreds of thousands of years , thus developing interpersonal traits ill-suited to vast , shifting confluences of an advanced civilized world .   Grygxxxfyqzxxx found the whole thing baffling , and , frankly useless . These upside-down creatures could never contribute to the massive , smoothly-humming machinery of the galactic ultra-cartel . Undoubtedly , they would only get bogged down by some biased personal priorities like kin and local communities , or - at best - align themselves with whatever slightly larger ( 300 million ? 900 million ? Bah ! ) organization who sells their own tribal biases back to them .   Better to turn the whole damn muddy ball into a tetra-magnophyraxian gamma-ball stadium , he decided , and launched the fleet 's entire swarm of genocidrones to wipe the little backwards planet clean of organic matter .
As per rule # 2 on the CYOA contest entry site :   `` All users must private-message me with their submission by May 10th . **All entries must remain unreleased until the contest thread is published . ** ''   The folks running the contest might take exception to any contestants putting out early releases of their entries . I believe they wanted to have the submissions released uniformly during the voting period . It 's probably not too late for you to clawback , though , if you take this down quick enough .   EDIT :   > I do most of my writing at my job   Certainly must be nice . Well , if you can possibly write *outside* of work hours ( that 's a very odd phrase to have to use ... for me , at least ) then I would *highly* recommend the CYOA system at [ Twinery.org ] ( http : //twinery.org ) that the contest runners suggest . Having considered entering the contest myself I 've dabbled with the system and I 've found it to be rather intuitive , fluid and adaptable . It also allows for more sophisticated branching than simple links to other Reddit threads .  
( Here 's a 3minute story . )     He awoke . His eyelids are heavy .   `` Wha ... ''   It took great effort to open his tired and weary eyes . In front of him , a tree .   `` Wha ... hap..ned ... . a..tree ? ''   `` That 's right . I remember now . I was driving to the cinemas..I was ... no ... **we** were on our way ... we ? We ! Sister ! ''   He panickly looked to the passenger seat . It was empty . Then he noticed . A hole on the windshield .   `` Oh no , sis ! ''   He rushed out of the wreck only to see the twisted body of his sister .   `` Sis ? Oh my god she 's dea ... ''   Then the body let out a breath .   `` Sister ! You 'll be fine , got it ? Do n't worry . ''   She wo n't . He knew that . Her waist was twisted in an undistinguishable manner , one leg missing , both arms were ripped off . Yet she still breathe .   `` Do n't worry , sis . I love you that is why I 'll save you . ''   Tears fell on his sister 's face as he placed his hands on her cheeks . She opened her mouth , no words came out but he heard her plea , and he answered .   *CRACK*

They never heard it coming . The Third British Invasion ripped their still beating hearts apart in the soldiers ' chests . Their noise-canceling helmets did n't stand a chance against Adele and her sorrowful voice . They lost New York and retreated to Appalachia where the Blue Grass hid them for a time . It was a long cold bitter winter for the United Musical Forces .   It was heard through the grapevine that the Country Regiment had tried to rally from Virginia but their song had become so diluted by Pop and their rhythms so obvious and repetitive that the Brits routed them .   All hope was lost when the Hiphop Clans fractured . With the New York sound gone their was nothing left but the debacherous rhymes of Atlanta . The West Coasters abandoned the East , believing that the vast silent emptiness of the plains would be a barrier to preserve them .   But there was a power growing . A sound without voice began to creep Northward . An orchestral blitzkrieg that surged forth . The March of the Empire reverberated off the southern hills . Disney was unleashed and with Williams leading them , a new hope began .
Dear fellas , I ca n't believe how fast things move on the outside . I saw a real firetruck once when I was a pup , but now they 're everywhere . The world went and got itself in a big damn hurry . The humans got me going to this big green stretch where they run me around and there 's other dogs I 've got ta be nice to . It 's hard work . I try to keep up , but my paws hurt most of the time . I do n't think 'Lil Nippy likes me very much . Sometimes after my runnin ' I leave some poops for the birds . I keep thinking Blacky might just show up and say hello . But he never does . I hope wherever he is , he 's doing okay and making new friends .   I have trouble sleeping at night . I have bad dreams , like I 'm falling . I wake up scared . Sometimes it takes me a while to remember where I am . Maybe I should get in the trash can and rip some shit up like old times , so they 'd send me home . I could bite the mean lady who yells at us when we get near Lettuce while I was at it , sort of like a bonus . I guess I 'm too old for that sort of nonsense anymore . I do n't like it here .   Hey , this ai n't the park ! What the hell is that silver thing ? Ow ... ... ... ...
I 've always wanted to be rich .   It is n't about the power , or the money , or the sex , or anything . I ca n't give orders . I do n't want anything I ca n't already get . I do n't want hollow one-night stands paid off with half-hearted kisses . I do n't even want to pay my wealth forward , I just want to hoard , to know I have it .   I just want to desire , to be desired . I do n't want to be alone when I 'm hurt . I want to trust someone , and be trusted . But each time I latch onto someone , hope that maybe I 'll work things out this time , all they see is the money I pour out at them , and they think I 'm trying to buy them . Maybe I am . I do n't mean to . I ca n't *stop* wanting it , wanting *them* .   There 's a difference , I know . Passion , I think , beyond intimate trust or action . But the line is so thin , and I do n't know how to make anyone understand . Most do n't even notice I 'm hiding all these thoughts from them . If they did , I wonder how I 'd pay rent , or buy food . And still there 's no one to comfort me from those dark thoughts .   God , how I wish I was rich .
Am I dead ? A few mornings ago - I 'm not even sure how long ago - I woke up . I felt very much alive . The sun was bright , the trees swaying in the breeze , the sky was blue , and not a person was there . There was an unusual silence through the empty streets . At first I had thought that maybe , for some unimaginable reason , the neighbourhood was evacuated , and they somehow forgot about me . I do n't know what happened . I rang every doorbell in town , knocked at more doors than I have ever in my entire life . And at each doorstep , that gut-wrenching feeling of being ... left behind , became more and more concrete . Where are the Smiths ? The Jacksons ? The Rhodes ' ? At each doorstep , at each unfamiliar name , I would pray that someone would open the door . I thought - am I stuck in a twisted dream ? Is this all one huge , merciless joke ? Have I gone insane ? I even reached the conclusion that I had died in my sleep and gone to Purgatory , where my soul would be cursed to roam the Earth in search of redemption . So that 's what I did . I walked , and walked , in hope of finding some other desperate soul , searching like me . Now I realize . I have died , and I 'm in Hell .
`` Is that an egg ? '' Jennifer asked shocked that they 'd received one at all . Ben picked up the new arrival off the blanket with his hands reverently looking at it from different angles .   `` ... I think it 's a bubble . Look '' Ben said passing it to her . `` You can see through it over here . '' Jennifer took the sphere admiring the shimmering little bubble , her hands were shaking so much she was afraid it might break . She passed it back to Ben , the bubble barely shifted in his warm hands . Jennifer looked up at Ben with big wet eyes .   `` S ... so you love me ? '' She asked finally , fearfully . Ben smiled , a little embarrassed .   `` You 're one to talk . You loved me first . '' they laughed together . They were each others first time and now they were each others first love . The kissed gently , they were terrified . They looked down at the little soap bubble they 'd made together .   `` What does it mean ? '' Jen was the one to ask . Ben put his arm around her and let her rest her head on his chest in silence . Ben laid the bubble down and closed his eyes enjoying her smell . They held very still like that for a long time . The bubble was very fragile and they did n't want to break it .  
He sits down beside his love , watching the sunset and leaning on an old willow tree . He watched the colours , the light , and everything else as it faded in the sunset , sitting beside his best friend , his lover , his sun that never set . Shades of blue filled the air and reminded him of her eyes , a dull blue that he never stopped seeing as beautiful . Yellows shone in the sky , tugging at his memory of their child , growing in her stomach . He saw orange light up the space around him , casting shades and making the old oak he was leaning on golden . Her hair was been golden , short , but wonderfully outlining the face of the woman he fell for .     Purple streaked the sky , and memories of his oddly painted purple house rose in his memories . She had always been the one to take chances . Pink coloured the clouds , making him smile . Pink was her colour , she loved every type . He had come to love it as much as she did .     He turned to her , expecting to see her silhouette , but only receiving space filled by a headstone .     `` I dream about you once in a while . You suppose that means anything ? '' He asked to the space , hoping some voice would reply .     No voice would come for him , no voice would reply , only the silent sounds of her laughter filled that empty space in his memory .
Her cool , magic filled hands caressed his strong figure as the two mages ducked into a hidden closet . Twin figures , one a radiant figure of healing energy , the other a pale reflection of silvery death , entwined and poured their hearts out to each other . Once the passions of both had been sated , Narcissa turned to her lover and said   `` Dearest Tristan , what of your father ? Surely a High Warlock does not want his son `` involved '' with someone like me , and certainly not with a Morningstar ! ''   `` Beloved Narcissa , it is the very arrogance and power lust my father extols as virtuous that drives me into your arms . His mad wars against your family and their allies have proven to me the futility of his methods . 20 years and not a single inch of land we fight for has been won . So yes , indeed do a edge myself to turn my magic against his forces and to end the cycle of bloodshed ! ''   The scrap of a door down the hall sends the two lovers into a frenzy of motion , as robes are pulled on , hair is bunned , and enchanted arms and armor strapped tight . On baited breath the Coue waits as the *click* of designer shoes carries Madame Collette past their hiding place , and once the overbearing witch had gone , they slipped out into the corridor . With longing gazes , they parted , Narcissa to the Morningstar Necromancy Wing , Tristan to the Clerical Paladin Barracks , of the Pigfreckles School of Spellcraft and Sorcery .
2nd May 2015 .   I turn on the TV for my regular *Lucha Underground* when I 'm surprised to find that the TV is not working . I tried everything ( yes , I did turn it off and back on ) , all to no avail . A black screen . It was as if my television was empty from the inside .   I called a person who fixes TVs . He tries everything in his arsenal , to no avail . He gives up after an hour , and leaves . I decide that it 's up to me if I want to catch at least the ending of that show I was going to watch .   I did n't know what to do . My mind was blank . I was going to go to the internet to torrent stuff , when I saw a button on my TV . A button I do n't recall seeing . On going close , it had the words `` INPUT '' written on them . Silly me . That 's a button that has always been there . You can blame that on my crappy eyesight .   I press it , for pressing 's sake . It leads to a video . There is this boy in the video , whom I can not see . It zooms in .   The boy is me . Bleeding everywhere .   The me in the video screams , '' *you did this ! * ''   I throw away my television in shock . I may never understand what this meant .
All my life I had been fascinated with the memories I can recall that were n't my own . Heterochromia iridum was always fascinating to me . I always felt like one of those unique dogs you see with mismatched eye colors . As a child , I would fondly recall hunting in the woods . I chased humans , but I was as quick as a wolf . My dreams of creeping through the night , undetected by others , always were so vivid . Finally as an adult , one night during one of my chasing dreams , I finally achieved my objective , I caught the human in the chase . Once I caught him , I tore him apart with my teeth . I could feel the blood drip down the sides of my mouth . It felt good , tasty , like BBQ sauce . I did n't want to wipe it off , it was delicious and a badge of honor . I was thrilled with the kill . Towards the end of the dream , right before I woke up , I saw something that chilled me to the bone . In this dream , I wiped away the blood from my mouth . It was n't a paw that wiped the blood away . I never caught the person in my previous dreams over the years . I wiped away the blood with my human hand . It was n't until I confronted my mother that she confessed . I was n't a person with an excess of melanin in one eye , I was the recipient of a donor eye .
Day 1   I write this because I believe there will be value in documenting this experience , foist upon me though it may be . I ... I feel alone . Frankly , it stings , the memories too painful to think about . I 'll process them later . For now I have ... other concerns . I **will** change this future I 've been forced into , even if it means I have to shatter my past .   Day ... I suppose it does n't matter .   It 's been years for me . I 've had alot of time to think about that moment . I thought that time would dull the wounds , allow me to remember without ... it has n't . I 've made myself relive it , her body in my arms , the blood dripping down her dress ... every damn night , I have to .   Its been years for me . It 's felt like an eternity . The damn cave 's taken so much from me . And arm . An eye . But I 've done it .   Its been years for me . No time has passed for them . Indeed , they 've aged backwards , a trivial amount to be sure , but crucially so .   Its been years for me . I will finally correct the mistakes of my past , and stop the murderer from taking her life . I can see him now .   Its been years for me . And I 'll erase them all right now .
Once upon a time , in some out of the way corner of the Hundred Acre Wood which is dispersed into numberless clustering trees and pathways , there was a bear upon which little brains invented 'bother . '   That was the most arrogant and mendacious minute of `` bothering , '' but nevertheless it was only a minute .   After a fear of heffalumps had drawn a few gasps , the forest 's fervor cooled and congealed , and the beastly apparitions had to die . - One silly little bear might invent such a fable , and yet one would still not have adequately illustrated how foolish , how honey-driven and temporary , the fear of an unknown looks within nature .   There were hillside adventures and stick races during which it did not exist . And when it is all over with the end of playing in the Wood , nothing will have happened . For this unbridled fear of figures has no additional mission , which would lead it beyond the edge of the forest .   Rather , it is a figment created by you and I , and its honey and bear takes it so solemnly - as though the trees and land 's axis turned within it .   For this `` bother '' contains within itself the most flattering estimation of the value of caring ; a concern for friends is the most general effect of such `` bother , '' but even in its most particular effects contain within themselves something of the same altruistic characters .
So I calmly said , `` it 's no different than the time machine , only instead of buttons there are pepperonis and instead of time travel there 's burping and shit . ''   `` Oh ok so how do we get in the pizza ? '' He asked as I decided this was n't the ideal place to explain this . Slowly we made our way out of subway ( with our vegan pizza ) towards my car which he somehow understands perfectly . It was as if he was a mechanic in a past life ; yet simple fast food menu nuances left him perplexed .   After showing him how to masturbate ( he could n't wait to go back to his time to show his friends and family what he 'd learned ) and him showing me how to fish , we chose subway by chance of the dice roll . It was either that or Wendy 's . On the way from the time machine to subway he saw a billboard of a kid with braces and he started singing . I could n't make heads nor tails of it . The song was beautiful though .   We get to subway . This dude really has no regard for manners . He saw a girl in front of us in line and shouted `` what that ass do ? '' and reached for a high five . Obviously I left him hanging to send a message . I just did the smart thing and ditched .
It was no secret I was in love with Veronica . I 'd known her a long , long time and we 'd always flirted , never dated . Something would always come up , like different Colleges , or we were each already in a relationship , just always something .   And here I was best man at her fucking wedding ! Best man , to a guy who I resented , no , envied and hated . I had always hated Alan , but he was the golden boy , the guy from the good family who was good at sports and school who had the best car in the parking lot when he was 16 . I was pretty sure he had asked me to his best man out of sheer malice : we were n't that close of friends , although we had known each other a long time .   As she came up the aisle , she looked radiant , glowing , just everything I could possibly have dreamed my wife to be , a heaven sent vision in white , just every God damn cliche for beauty you could think of .   And it was at that point , the absolute nadir of my existence , the dark night of my soul , the equivalent of Tattoo from Fantasy Island using a pogo stick to jump on my heart 's crotch , when the first guitar chords of `` Jessie 's Girl '' came blaring out .   It was at that point that I said fuck it , pulled my dick out and began to urinate on the Brides beautiful dress .
First response , finally something I can do !   I walk into the room . *Well at least the corner 's open , * I think to myself . Yet another day in my horrible math class .   This class is full of the exact type of people I do n't like . The mega stoners . The douchebags . The popular , hyper-chatty girls . Everyone I go to great lengths to avoid . *At least I have reddit , * I think to myself . Yet another day in my horrible math class .   The teacher 's nice enough , but I can barely focus . My morning 'Dew is wearing off , and I do n't have any ones for the vending machine . Not that I would skip part of the class to go there . Ok . I probably would for this class .   Nobody is quiet in the class . Except me . Nobody sits at my table for me to talk to . I prefer it that way though . More time to browse reddit . It does n't affect my schoolwork or grades . I prefer it this way .   And before I know it , the bell rings . Time for a class I actually care about .
Mary was happy .   This Woods cafe by Bayview was where he took them on a first of many dates . A year later , and they still came to this refuge by the ocean often . There lay an immense , pool of salt water that spanned towards great distances , and the drive to this Bayview cafe was only a few minutes from the apartment . The two had gone through great distances of their own to make this relationship work , but they were free to be with each other fully . And what a time it was to be in love .   After graduating college , Mary became a nurse for the disabled . She was appreciated for her work . Appreciated at home . Appreciated on spring afternoons over a caramel mocha , on an outside table , in the ocean breeze and the company she shared this day with . Yesterday ended with a promise ;   `` I 'll take you to Bayview tomorrow . ''   Mary was happy . How fortunate she was to have a girlfriend who still understood how moments like these worked . An afternoon at this Woods cafe by Bayview did n't need a question . It did n't need uncertainty , or hesitation , or a scheduling conflict . This place was special , and they appreciated that .   This was just one of many dates the two would enjoy together . The two had gone through great distances to make this relationship work . There was no need for conflict anymore . Only time . And they had plenty of it to go .   -- -   *More at r/galokot , and thanks for reading ! *
He 's chasing me . I 've tried to escape his captivity before but it is no use . This is a fruitless effort and he will catch me before long , but this is as far as I 've made it and I wo n't stop now .   I cut off the road towards some trees . He 's getting closer . I can hear each of his steps getting louder and louder behind me . If I can just make it to the trees maybe I can lose him .   I make it into the trees . The brush is thicker than I expected . This will be good for me since I 'm smaller . I zig and zag between branches attempting to allude his grasp . The noise of cracking and bending branches follows me but it 's getting softer every moment . It 's working , it 's slowing him down . But I zag too hard and twist my ankle on the surfaced root of a tree . I collapse face down on the ground writhing in pain . Footsteps signal his approach . His pace slows with every step until it stops altogether . He 's standing over me . This is it , my life ends here .   I feel him grasp at my hand and attempt to turn me over . I resist and he pulls more violently . He gives a strong pull and I am jerked awake . There he is , the monster of my dreams standing over me . I smile and say `` Good morning honey . '' Then I get up and go about my day as if nothing is wrong .    
Please , you must save my son , '' cried a young woman in the hall . Fluorescent lights buzzed and flickered as Gabriel strode toward the surgery room . Each room he passed had a hungry face looking out , hands stretched toward Gabriel 's stiff white coat . Their cries were endless .   `` My wife is dying , please help , '' sobbed a man in a left hand room .   `` My sister 's tumor ... please remove it , '' begged a little girl in a right hand room .   `` Every day is much the same , '' muttered Gabriel as he stepped into the scrubbing station . The surgery room was prepped with his latest patient , and a small team of nurses waited with tools .   `` It will take a small miracle to save this child , '' whispered one of the nurses to another . `` The cancer is aggressive , and it 's everywhere . '' The other nurse shook her head sadly .   Gabriel stepped carefully up to the table , surveying the young boy 's chart . He did indeed have cancer just about everywhere : his brain , one of his lungs , and a touch of it on his stomach . Gabriel looked up at the nurses around him , and then directed a level gaze at the nurse who had spoken . `` I guess it 's lucky that I 'm in the market for miracles , '' he said , and a small white feather fell to   the floor .
Peace , honor , truth , power , fortune . What the hell do I choose ? I think I must have spent hours in that room pacing back and forth . I came close to opening the Power door a few times . But this could be one of those tests of moral ambiguity . Would I get punished for walking in the wrong door ?   I begin eliminating options .   Peace . Honestly ? Nah . I ’ m selfish , I know .   Honor . Eh , that can pass . There was nothing honorable about being a slightly overweight loser who spends the entire day on the computer .   Truth . I ’ m curious , but not enough .   Power . This is where things start to get interesting . Everyone who made my life the way it is today – if I can make them pay…   Wait , remember what Uncle Ben said – “ With great power comes great responsibility. ” Fuck , I can ’ t believe I ’ m taking advice from a fictional character…   Fortune . Luck has never really been on my side . Maybe this is where things begin to change .   I grasp the doorhandle on Fortune , take a deep breath and take a step in . My eyes are flooded with harsh , sterile light . A man with glasses and solemn face is standing over me . My mother is crying .   “ Mr Graham you have suffered a cardiac arrest . You were in a induced coma for 3 months. ”    
As i squeezed through the sea of people , the crowd that was forming in Times Square grew ever so larger .   There were n't any events , no occasions . it 's just another day , June 14th . I was puzzled about why there would be such a large crowd today .   As i approach the centre of the crowd , i catch onto one of the many conversations in the crowd .   `` He claims to be God '' one man said , `` his just a lunatic making a scene . '' Another replied .   As sudden as a bolt of lightning , a voice boomed through the crowd .   `` SILENCE ! '' .   The conversations stop . The voices in the crowd fell to a low mumble . Everyone was focused on the mysterious man , dressed in white . Standing in the center .   `` I am God , of the heavens above . I created the human race , and today , i bring a message , reflecting the current states of affairs on earth . ''   `` What ? '' A rude man among the crowd called out .   `` You are all fucked . '' The man said , as he fades away from the scene .   Panic and chaos ensues .

The greatest colonial powers , Spain , Portugal , England , France , seemed Titans that would stand the test of time . Invincible , each crushed the natives of its chosen provinces with horrifying brutality and awe-inspiring ease , slowed only by their wars amongst themselves . To fight them was folly , madness .   General Washington 's grip on his sword tightened as he stared out into the flurrying snow at Valley Forge . This was no natural storm - no , the storm that starved his men , that kept them pinned here , was the work of the King and his leftist have sorcery , Washington was sure . He could hear it whisper , sometimes , right as he crossed the edge from wakefulness to sleep . He drank herb teas to ensure that he had no dreams . He had executed another three men today for what he was euphemistically calling `` desertion '' - that is , taking leave of their senses , being reduced to gibberish lunatics thirsting for blood and the madness of the Elder Gods .   He took a long pull of his tea , livened up with brandy . Franklin said the herbs would protect his mind , but a little alcohol steadied his nerves better than anything else could .   Washington fixed the faint winter sun with a stern glare . He would endure , and when Spring came , the Army would march forth .   God help us all .
I looked at myself in the mirror , I had aged noticeably . When I had taken the office I had n't had a single grey hair on my head , now I struggled to find one that was n't .   It 's sad that I should be executed tomorrow really . Under my rule America had completely turned it 's momentum around . I had legalized marijuana completely as well as declaring the legal age of consent down to 15 years old . I had changed our national anthem to 'who let the dogs out and raised the bar on what qualifies as obese , ending America 's obesity epidemic in one swift gesture . I had single handedly ended the war on terrorism on America by making us a third world country and began to build a new theme park , 'seven flags ' , on the moon .   I had done well . A tear rolled down my cheek .   A brick came crashing through my window , I looked outside and saw a mob of what appeared to be millions holding signs , `` DIE SCUM ! `` , some said , others saying `` LITERALLY HITLER ! ''   I was touched , such passion . I do n't remember any president before me being serenaded to their execution by such a large crowd .   /r/PsychoWritingPrompts
She stood in front of me , beautiful as she ever was , her tinted green eyes piercing me . I could barely look at her . `` Well , are you going to say anything ? '' she asked .   I stuttered . `` Liz , I , I do n't know what to say . That caught me off guard . ''   `` Come on Matt , it 's been three years . I 've changed . I realize that what I did was wrong . Just forgive me . Please . '' Tears streamed from those gorgeous eyes and ran down her freckle-covered cheeks .   `` Liz , you cheated on me . More than once . He sent me a fucking video of it , Liz ! ''   She was sobbing now . `` We were only seventeen ! How real could what we had have been anyways ? ! We were too young for something serious ! ''   Another hit to my gut . `` Damn you , Liz . I 'm not surprised you think that . It makes sense why you cheated . But I do n't care what you think or what you just said . There 's no way we 're getting back together . ''   She collapsed to the floor , pounding her fists on the pavement . `` I said I 'm sorry ! How can you not miss me ? ! ''   `` Just because I hate you , does n't mean I do n't miss you . '' I turned away , making sure she could n't see the tears as they ran down my own face . `` Damn you , Liz . Damn you . ''  
( I 've never really tried writing a poem , let 's try this ! )   With pride I strode into the shop ,   Then sheepishly walked away ( I was lost ) .   But three doors down , a squat brick shack of brown   with open door and hardwood floor and collectibles all strewn around .     I bounded up to the clerk , dubious how such cards would work .   But I held those thoughts back , bought a new pack and into the corner I lurked .   The new card smell ( surprise ! ) was nothing new , and the foil pack just a basic blue .   Yet excitement and dread , equal in my head , and the cards to my shock were quite few .     Just five ! I felt I 'd been cheated !   My hard earned cash , just simply deleted .   Put I picked out the first , now fate could not be reversed , and to go back and change it I pleaded .     Much to my surprise ( and delight ) , I found myself turning off my office light .   Then shutting the door ( as three nights before ) , and my harrowing blight was no more .   I smiled , craned my neck and laughed , the thoughts of vengeance : against no mercy clashed/   My fury grew , and last I knew that 'fore dinner , I 'd discard that bad Hash .
All the dragon folk are gathered in a conference room . They 're all making small talk and seeing how the past few thousand years have gone for one another . Then a man walks on a stage in the center of the room . He is adorned with gold jewelry and unfitting clothes . The crowd sees him and silences immediately , watching and waiting to hear what word he has brought . He stands at a podium and speaks ;   `` WHAT 'S UP EVERYBODY HOW WE ALL DOING TONIGHT ? ''   The crowd gasps and is confused as to what 's happening   `` ARE WE ALL READY TO GET DOWN AND PARTY ? '' He bounces enthusiastically all over the stage . His efforts to `` pump '' up the crowd are futile . He gives a whistle and a group of buxom scantly clad women , wearing tightly fit clothing , walk on stage carrying a turntable . They set it down in front of the energetic speaker .   `` LET 'S GET THIS PARTY STARTED ! ''   He then goes to work . He lays down the sickest jams and beats and just goes nuts . He carries on for another few minutes and looks up from his jamtable only to see a crowd of confused and slightly irritated people .   `` Is n't this the 15th annual Jam Party Jam Jam ? '' He asks   The crowd shakes their head in unison .   Down the hall screams of terror are heard . Someone enters the conference room and yell `` Run ! The DJ at the Jam Party Jam Jam just turned into a damn dragon ! ''
The thing nobody tells you about cryosleep is how much it hurts when you wake up . I mean think about it . You 're sitting immobile for decades and you think our muscle mass is going to stay the same ? The high protein diet before the launch and even the electrical stimulation the system runs do n't amount to more than ways to stave off the atrophy .   `` Greetings , Captain Sullivan . Destination found . Habitable planet within range . ''   `` Thank you , Computer . Launch probes . Time to destination ? ''   `` The planet is one standard month away from destination , as per cryosleep protocols . Gravity intensification regimen slated to start at 0200 hours . Probes launched . ''   `` Good . Please get me something for this headache . ''   `` Unable to comply with medication request as medical protocols have not been run . ''   `` Dammit computer I do n't need ... ''   `` Beginning medical evaluation . Diagnosis ; dehydration . Administering additional water supplements . Medication not required . ''   `` I hate you , computer . ''   `` Noted for the one hundred and fourty seventh time , captain . Probes are detecting transmissions from destination planet . ''   `` Analysis ? ''   `` Local sentient life has information network similar to the Nexus in its early stages . Accessing . '' There was a moments pause . `` Planet designation changed . Destination : Earth . ''     `` That 's a shitty name for a planet . ''
`` You 're from Earth ? ''   `` Yeah , I am . ''   Most human beings have migrated to other planets , leaving the small , blue-green planet barren and untended . At least it 's rare for a normal human being to live there .   `` How , '' Caesar then immediately reply , piqued with curiosity , `` is it like ? ''   His fellow earthling stopped to think . It was not like there has n't been anything good . He just did n't know where to start .   `` TV ... '' That 's the only thing he can think of .   `` TV ? '' Caesar raised an eyebrow . `` What 's that ? ''   `` A box with moving pictures , I guess ? ''   `` You mean like our surveliance system ? ''   `` No , no , no . We watch it for fun , not for work . ''   `` Fun ? '' That word striked the non-Earth dweller as odd . No one has 'fun ' in this day and age . They were too focused not to let the space aliens invade their territory !   `` Fun . And they usually watch something they call 'Glee . ' And this show -- ''   Needless to say , Caesar was dumbstruck . He never knew how humans could dance around while spouting melodious sounds . The thought of that scared him . The Earth dwellers were not what he had expected . He was not even sure he would visit the place .
A darkened state ? I must be late . I 've missed the trip to visit heaven 's gate . Though , it feels not like hell ; No burning or searing . Then a slow fated conclusion in my head started gearing . This was n't heaven , this was n't hell . I 'm locked in a box ; a dirt covered shell . I ca n't move my body , my arms or my legs . I ca n't even kick , scream , scratch or beg . What had I done wrong ? What of my beliefs ? Has a life of pious worship left me trapped here underneath ?   My thoughts , I feel them all , but not the oxygen I lack . I know not of my eye 's workings . Is it white ? Is it black ? Please save me , please find me , please know that I 'm alive . I knew I died too young , It 's not too late for me to thrive .   No one 's coming , no one came , no one will . Years and years of torment is the only thing that 's real . Everything I could n't do in life , I can now sit and reflect ; but of everything I come to solve , from my hole I ca n't eject .
There was a silence that I have never heard before when I took the wrong turn from my Da , I knew I was in serious trouble , not only when I was found..but what was waiting for me in the shadows of the cold winter night . How could a seven year old girl who has rarely ever been outside past her bedtime make it through such a dark and miserable night where the eyes of her bedtime monsters consume her faith and integrity of her innocent mind ?   `` Must find momma '' she whimpers through her scarf .   I wander towards what looks to be a million yellow eyes overlooking my every move , being told from a young baby about how monsters were just make believe , I am starting to believe differently . My mind never crosses over what has happened to my daddy , since he is my only daddy , I know he is brave and will be okay . He is looking for me now , I swear it ... .the arms of the monsters wrap themselves around me , and I am to never been seen again .   In the morning after last nights events of the night , Daddy stumbles upon foot prints in the freshly fallen snow . It is as if she came here on her own knowing what was going to happen to her , there were no shifting in her prints , only confident steps . There was a tree crested ravine about five miles from the car accident , and her prints stop there ... and so do daddy 's .
It had seemed so perfect .     The one goddess who truly understood me , i had thought .     The one goddess truly representing me , my teenage self had thought .     The one goddess poised to piss my parents of , my teenage emo self had thought .     Goddess of monsters , goddess of darkness , goddess of *spiders* ( a surefire way to freak out my mom ) .     And then ... and then it had turned out that Lolth was actually *cheerful* .     Like , *urgh* .     Spiders followed me everywhere , carrying little treats , scaring away my perceived `` enemies '' ( that part was actually quite cool ) or shooing me away from `` danger '' .     And then there was the knitting .     Barely a day passed without me finding knew ( and admittedly stylish ) spidersilk clothes .     It felt like ... it felt like constantly being accompanied by your mom .     Have you ever tried dating a girl with a thousand spiders sitting on the table , simultaneously turning their bodies to stare at whoever was speaking right now ?     Like , ***urgh*** .     I open my door to step inside . My high school bully is hanging in a net from the ceiling . He screams through his gag as he sees me .     I grin .     Maybe Lolth is n't so bad after all .
`` Oi Reginald , di 'd you hea the whaddabouts on homeworld ? ''   `` Aye , I have mate I been ringin me mum but she 's not picked up her interscreen since it happened ... I 'm blowing off every hour I is . ''   `` Come now Reginald she 's probably out in the country somewhere safe ''   `` Nah , mate me mum 's a crazy sod , she 's probably looting the local market as we speak that 's what 's got me so fagged , she was always going on and on saying if the end of the world came she 'd break every glass window she could find and even pay Mr. and Mrs. Sullivan a visit for not keeping their yard nice and tidy ... one of the reasons I 'm up here is cause she wanted me to become an engineer and join in the Martian excavation so I could send her wads of quid '' .   `` Cobblers Reg ... Cobblers ''   `` Yeah , she 's probably going to join The Dark Lord 's army now '' .   `` Well Reg , at least we 're up here and she 's down there ... ''   Suddenly a rumble in Cidonia ...   `` WHAT WAS THAT ! ? ! ? ! ''   `` Reginald , I think we have company ... its all of them raptured types they 've come out of one of the pyramids we 've been excavating '' .   `` BOLLOCKS ! ! Me Dad 's here ... . ''
My soulmate ! I 'm so excited !   All my life I 've dreamed of finding the perfect guy , or girl I guess , and living a life of bliss . Now it can happen . Science just released a closed beta on a device that mentally leads you to your soul mate .   And my family made the list of the five-thousand nationwide beta testers .   Well I say my whole family , but Mom and Dad opted out of the trial to avoid marital complications .   Now I 'm walking down the street towards a convenience store . My mental lead draws me in and towards a display of candy . Must be something wrong because no one is here .   It 's really drawing me to the Reese 's Cups . I pick up a couple of packages , but the lead is n't satisfied until I pick up the whole box and carry it to the cashier .   Is he my soulmate ? He looks kinda cute ...   Nope . Got my Reese 's and leave the store . I zero in on a nearby bench and go to sit down . Stay here , I sense .   I open a package of canda and start to eat when the feeling in my head gets stronger . They 're here !   `` Ooh , Reese 's Cups . Can I have one ? ''   I know that voice .   I look up in confused terror . No . God , no ! There must be a mistake .   She stares back with the same look of horror . I 'd peg it as identical , even .   She 's my twin sister .
Liv ,   Things had ... well have been tough . You know that . I know that . It 's been a few years since we last talked but I 've missed every second . Truthfully ? You were right . Always were . I ca n't rebuke it anymore . I needed to figure my shit out before we could take this on . Update : I still have n't . Better , making progress , not quite there though .   I still have a photo of you . From our first dance . God it brings me to tears when I see it , so I hide it away . Just like so many things I guess .   You were my first . The first to understand . First to love . First to feel .   I miss you . You 're happy now and I 'm happy for you .   Here 's to hoping I 'll figure my shit out . At least partially . I still have the ring too . Dusty now and in the skeleton closet but still there . Just wish you could 've seen how beautiful it is .   That 's all I guess . Never was the talkative one in our relationship .   I 'd say goodbye but I ca n't let go just yet . Not yet .  
I looked up from the deep gash on my wrist , where blood should of been , there was simply a vary of wires and metal frame .   `` Okay , this is different ... '' I said glancing over to my girl freind .   `` Johnny , you 're like Anakin Skywalker from that movie you love so much '' she said , examining the wires .   `` I 'm still confused '' I replied glancing at my arm again .   At this point , my brother burst in .   `` Hey johnny '' he said stopping when he saw me examining the wires coming out if my arm .   `` Oh , right . You found out ? ''   `` Found out what ? '' I said looking at him .   `` A few months back , you had accident , your fore arm was crushed and severed . They gave you a cybernetic one instead , and they said you might not remember the incident '' he looked guiltily at Me .   `` Awesome ! '' I said as my girl freind threw a black glove like the one from the movie .   I pulled it on , smiling .   I always thought robot arms where cool .    
At first the signal was strange . Fascinating . `` How did a Wi-Fi signal get all the way up on Mars ? '' James wondered aloud . One of the first humans to set foot on the Red Planet , and the last thing he expected was for there to be a WI-FI signal .   Jeremy looked at him . `` Really ? Is it not obvious ? ''   James shook his head , still baffled by the complexity of such a riddle .   Alice rolled her eyes and sighed . `` Really James . For such a smart guy you can be soooo dumb sometimes . It was placed here in advance by *robots* that SpaceX sent a couple months ago . Duh . How else would we be able to communicate back to Mission Control ? ''   James turned a shade of red that would have rendered him invisible in the Martian desert . `` Oh . I had n't thought of that . Wow . ''   Ivy laughed and said , `` Come on you guys ! We are on *MARS ! * We can talk about how stupid James is later . Lets get out of this rocket ! ''   With that , James had to agree . They had a lot of work to do .   In perfect coordination , they all touched their boots on the martian surface at the same time , so they would all be recognized as the first crew of humans to set foot on Mars . It was a monumental day in human history . Additionally , James was the subject of many memes from Earth in throughout the next couple of weeks .   Edit : Words
Order . Without it , there would be chaos .   When the news blared that annoying sound and told us to go to the nearest National Guard depot , I thought about it . They 're trying to order us , understandably - I mean we are being invaded after all . But if you think about it , what next ? Civilians are n't soldiers , we wo n't listen to orders if food starts running out , or if our depot happens to be attacked !   So when I was done thinking , I did the only rational thing someone should do . Go to work . Let the military quell the invasion , let the scientists work on how to kill them better , let the government issue executive orders , let the people go to work .   Surprisingly enough , on my way to work , at my work , and on my way back from work no robot attacked me . I think I might 've seen around 8 of those big metallic fuckers , but I think they appreciated the order . Maybe that 's what they want .   A routine , a never changing day where we do the same things we did yesterday . Order - it 's beautiful .
In the beginning , there was Ashum . The planet , in all its lush and potential sat still in the chaos that surrounded it . And then the titans came . Six brothers and one bastard descended upon Ashum and bore life upon it . Mahakam and his elven people were the first to populate the lands , with swords made of meteorite and cities made of glass . Then came Huron and his humans , who crossed the frigid winterlands to do battle with the elves . Durge and his dwarves took to the mountains with Yillith and her gnomes and together they carved the magnificent stone city of Valok . Callig , inspired by his brother Huron and of the natives of Ashum made the half-orcs . But , his attempt at flattery to his brother were ultimately what led to his peoples downfall . Xen , the youngest sister felt little need to war with her brothers , and so made the halflings in the quiet hills next to the ocean , where she left them guarded by a forest filled with trickster faeries and ferocious ettins . Finally , after all were created , the brothers left to create elsewhere , but the bastard stayed behind . Jealous of Hurons work , Kalagur bit his thumb and slipped a drop of his blood into the land , which fell upon the humans . Twisted by his blood , the humans afflicted by his curse became tieflings , born of bastard blood . And so the races of Ashum were born , left to thrive or perish under the titans forgotten gaze .
My alarm goes off for the fourth time this morning , and a hand fumbles for the snooze button . This time though , I put mine in the way . My partner 's fingers interlock with mine and I sigh deeply , pressing a kiss to their hand .   I 've been awake for hours already , and my calendar stares at me . Today is marked with a large X and it 's been circled many a time in green felt tip . There 's another , two days after . That day is circled in blue . Our favourite colours for the days we die .   The worst part is that we have to act normal .   I get out of bed first and make us both tea before getting in the shower .   Our everyday routine takes longer today , as it did last year , because in between the usual there 's extra kisses and extra whispers of I love you .   Last year felt like a miracle when we both survived the month .   Today however , I do n't even make it to work .   As I lay in my blood , road and pavement traffic held up , all I can think of is what will happen in two days time , before I hear a familiar voice calling my name .   A face blurs before me and I know who it is just from the way my heart soars on its final beat .   I 'm vaguely aware of warm arms holding me and then everything fades .
`` So you have no idea what it does . '' I did n't really expect him to know , I was only asking him as a last resort . I did n't notice the button for several weeks , and by then he was already enjoying the life of a newly retired president . Nevertheless , after pouring through every file I could find on the subject of this desk , I was left empty handed and more confused than anything .   & nbsp ;   `` Nope , never gave it too much thought . '' He said .   & nbsp ;   Oh well . Worth a try anyways .   If nobody knows , it ca n't be that big of a deal , right ?   Right ?   & nbsp ;   I have more important things to obsess over than a mystery button , anyways .   It can wait , and wait it did . Days become months , months become years .   Eventually , towards the end of my second term , I remember the button squirreled away within my desk .   & nbsp ;   What 's the worst that can happen , right ?   It 's just one , large , red , ominous , 1950's-esque button .   & nbsp ;   Feeling entirely too optimistic , I reach over and lay my hand on the large button . There is a thick layer of dust on it , clearly not having been disturbed in recent memory . I push down , the button is surprisingly firm and requires some force .   *CLICK*   & nbsp ;   Nothing . The button did noth-   A tinny , old voice begins to play over the the entire buildings intercom .   & nbsp ;   `` That was easy ! ''  
The line was never flat . It may have stuttered before , but for the first time , green against black , the line was flat .   Pauline had heard of death , but there was something so archaic about it ... it never crossed her mind , the fact that an existence could be ephemeral . This world had never known of a life ending , only humans did , and for god 's sake , we are n't humans .   There was always a comfort in immortality . Being born without consequences . Pauline was still young , 86 . A nurse .   Sickness in this world was just discomfort . No one likes a stuffy nose or a broken arm .     She had seen only a fraction of what this world had to offer , yet felt as though she had seen it all . In this world so similar to what Earth once was , her days began to melt into one . Rising with the Sun , sleeping only after her children , grandchildren and great-grandchildren were fed .   She jumped from cliffs , planes . Tried drugs . Like everyone did .     She had made mistakes . Loved . Lost . But she always found herself new friends ... new lovers . Like everyone had . She had traveled to the shells of old civilisations , great and powerful , reduced to only dust .     Being at the hospital when the first one passed , she did not sleep that evening . She wondered only one thing .   Without an end , is there a beginning ?
That 's right , research into the oceans is restricted , not by physics , not by material constraints , but by him , Arthur Curry . Atlantis owns the seas and they have declared that below a certain depth we are entering their domain . Their king , a God among us , is wealthier than any Arab Prince . His influence on world leaders , both through lobbying and his recent admittance into the United Nations , is unprecedented .   Now , you might ask , what are they hiding , why do n't they want us down there ? According to Curry it 's not about exploration , but the human capacity for exploitation that Curry fears . He 's proposed a new way though . In a treaty , signed with the United Nations , Curry promises to share Atlantean technology with the surface , given the promise that they use it to remove their dependence on fossil fuels in the next 5 years .   Already Bruce Wayne , Oliver Queen , Ray Palmer , and Ted Kord have announced an unprecedented group effort to reverse engineer technologies that can be readily applied to address the world 's energy needs . Luthor Corp also has plans with the technology , though , due to censures placed on the company , access to certain information will be restricted .   If we can meet Curry 's deadline , he says , then humanity will be one step closer to being allowed to explore the deep .  
'Mommy I 'm scared ' - my youngest clutched me tight .   'It 's ok baby it 's not real it 'll stay dark I promise '   I did n't believe the myth - those stories are over 100 years old and you know how things get warped with time . People born in the light ? And to think how the stories write of the 'oncoming darkness ' like it 's some terrible looming evil . The darkness is so lovely , like a blanket .   In the stories of the light they always write about beauty - people pine after , write poems , fight over people they think are visually appealing ? That seems so wrong . In the dark there is no physical beauty . Beauty comes from what you say and do . How you act ? Surely that 's more important ?   They write about wars too . There is no war here in the dark . Life is difficult ; there is no other way than to co-operate , we live so close together to keep us all safe . Sure people argue but we have peaceful means of settling disputes .   A bright line appears on the horizon and I hold my child closer .
I set up that blanket in the park as she set the basket down .   `` Did you remember to pack the soda this time ? '' I asked as I reached for the bag of crisps at the bottom .   `` Yes dear . '' She replied , passing me a can . `` I do n't know why you insist on coming out here to watch them , nothing ever happens . ''   `` It 's where we met , it 's like a tradition you know ? Besides , eventually one of them will die of old age and then all those bets I made will pay off . ''   We sat back as we watched the two statue like figures on the hilltop . Three months ago was the day that Stopwatch had gone to put a stop to Hindsight 's reign of terror . Unfortunately , when the two locked eyes , with the whole city watching from television screens , they froze . Their powers completely counteracted each other ; and neither was capable of breaking the cycle . I had met Sarah while I was going to study them for my physics class , understanding the time flow was always done on a theoretical level , but having access to something like this was like looking through a murky window ; understanding was just beyond our grasp . She was there painting the park and the people in it ; she kept me company , and I did her .   Maybe one day one of them would pass out like I said , but as I watched their sidekicks feeding their frozen bodies and bantering with each other , part of me hoped they never would .

All day , and all night , he works . He works , works , works , usually until I 'm already in bed . Weekends , too . I have n't seen him in so long ...

I woke up on the morning of my eighteenth birthday , as pumped as I had ever been . I ran out of my room as fast as I could , stumbling over my own feet . I just needed to make it out of the dining room , where my family was sitting , so we could figure out my new power .   I made my way through the doorway and saw my mom sitting at the head of the table . She did n't look happy to see me . That 's when I saw the gun in her hand as she raised it up to her temple , squeezing her eyes shut . Then , an instant before the gun fired , it all vanished . It has been a vision . My mother was sitting there , looking at me with a worried expression .   `` Are you alright , honey ? '' She asked.. I managed to stutter that I was okay and turned to face my sister .   The same kind of vision as before . This time , I saw a car crashing through the walls , and vanishing an instant before it struck her .   I screwed my eyes up tight .   My power .   I can see how people die .
`` Well he always was a bit dense . '' Said Kathy .   `` A bit dense ! HA ! A 70 year old man somehow still in the prime of his youth and just now he wonders about it ? A bit dense ... that 's a very kind way to put it . Somebody with a brain should have his fortune , there would be no limit to the good they could do . Why do the half-wits always win the lottery ? '' Sue replied , shaking her head .   `` You know I can hear you , right ? '' I called from the other room , annoyed at my decrepit and aging younger siblings .   `` Yes of course you can hear me . You do n't have hearing aids you dim-witted meathead . ''   Sue was always my favorite sister . Perhaps she can be forgiven , it must be difficult to feel the pains of age and watch your brother still bounce around with a spring in his step and not a care in the world .   But she was wrong about one thing . I intend to do good in this world . Just now I 'm packing my bags to get on a plane that will take me to Baltimore where I 'll be paying a visit to John Hopkins Medical School . The fabled Fountain of Youth is coursing through my veins and the researchers there are ... well to say they are interested is to put it mildly . Maybe we can live forever .  
On a lone and tiny moon lives a species of creature divided into three distinct species united together under three distinct tribes .   The tribe that roams at the forefront of dawn are tall and elegant , they walk in a perpetual Spring of abundant food , living heartily and leaving what they ca n't bring with them in their travel .   The tribe that walks in the Tall Suns staggers forward , eating what they may find remaining that has not wilted and lapping up the drying river beds . A hunger surges them forward and their gaunt frames move with great efficiency from shade to shade for the briefest of respites , endlessly chasing the dawn .   The final tribe that walks in the Darkness skitters tirelessly , scavenging what ever they can and ruthlessly surviving in their nocturnal territory by any means . They are driven forward by the frozen wasteland of the moons night , which promises to wipe out all who stray within its reach .   It has been said that at times the tribes have all walked together , but as a larger group moves slowly , there were those who would travel on ahead to live in the dawn .
No one knows where she came from , who her parents are , or where she 's going . I 've asked .   So now I just watch . *The Piper* they call her .   I 'm not entirely sure , but I recall there use to be a `` Pied '' somewhere in there , if one is referring to the fairy tales . In any case , I 'm a man of cheap thrills , and I know of several other *Pipers* in various back alleys that you can buy for the cost of a coffee and bagels . So , I just call her Catherine -- Cat , for short .   Speaking of cats ...   Black , sleek ones . The ones that superstitious folks keep ladders and mirrors away from . Yes , *those* type of cats . Whenever she plays on her flute , they come out in droves and follow her , as if she 's their Bast ( Ancient Egyptian Cat Goddess ) .   Today she 's on the tracks . The train tracks . I can see her from my outdoor table as I read through the newspaper . She 's playing a peice that 's more than exquisitely beautiful today . I put the paper down and listen . I have no choice ; the music is simply too magical to resist .   She does n't hear it . Not at first . Nor do I . So lost in the magic are we . And by the time we do , it is far , far too late .

I was 21 years old at a crowded theater . The lights dimmed , the movie began , and all of a sudden , I could hear everyone . Every person 's thoughts in the theater .   The guy up front who had already seen the movie three times before spoiled the ending for me . The couple in the back who were having sex . The man seven seats over who was thinking about his business 's finances . And perhaps , worst of all , my date who was wondering why she was stuck with a loser like me and how much she missed her ex-boyfriend .   I shut it off . I shut it all off . Went back to silence in my head . I do n't even remember the movie .   The next evening , playing poker with my friends , I opened back up , read their thoughts , won over $ 45 ( a lot of money at the time ) .   And never used the power again .   I 'm sure there is some way I could have used the power for good , but the temptation to use it for evil would also be there . The potential I could hear someone 's thoughts and know what they really thought could really hurt me and my relationships with friends and family .   The power came with a cost , and it was a cost I was n't willing to pay . So I 've kept it shut off for the 60 years since .
“ Can I get you more juice ? ” said Lavinia .   Tad , straining against his bonds in the metal chair at the far end of the conference table , wriggled . “ You ’ re one sick puppy , you know that ? ”   “ I love puppies ! ” said Lavinia .   “ You know the only thing more bloated than your waistline is your ego , ” said Tad .   “ Not nice . No juice. ”   “ Listen , I wouldn ’ t even be here if I hadn ’ t been blackmailed into it . I still can ’ t believe that bastard found those spring break pictures. ”   “ What , ” said Lavinia , looking genuinely startled , “ you ’ re telling me you ’ re not here to save the world ? ”   “ I ’ m here to get those pictures back , porky . No other reason. ”   “ You got through my swim-spa moat. ”   “ Yes. ”   “ And the Hall of a Hundred Bitey Kittens. ”   “ Yep. ”   “ And my Honor Guard of Politeness. ”   “ Well , no . Obviously . Bastards can run when they ’ re pissed. ”   “ All because you didn ’ t care about the fate of the world ? ”   “ Just not that motivated , no. ”   “ Then you won ’ t be too upset that when my plan succeeds you and everyone on this planet dies . Problem solved ! – How about a cookie , do you want a cookie ? ”  
They say finding your soulmate is one of the best things you can do in your life . The joy and happiness it brings into your life is incomparable to everything else - nothing even comes close .   When I met her for the first time , I did n't know that my whole life would revolve around her . She was just another girl in one of my classes , and yet I found myself talking to her every day , dreaming of her , writing down her likes and dislikes . Before her , I 'd never even bothered to learn or remember someone 's favorite color , or flower , or anything for that matter . I lived my life for myself ; I now live for her .   Within a year , we had become an item - inseparable , my love for her was unparalleled - the stuff of legends . In five years , I found myself deeper in love than I 'd ever even known possible . Our love blossomed and we had a long marriage and life together .   I am old now , decades have passed .   I miss her every day .
`` Look , all I 'm saying is that if they see you , you 've got to be wearing the outfit ! ''   `` It 's a ridiculous outfit ! It does n't even fit . ''   `` I think it looks great . It 's actually quite flattering . Slimming , really ''   `` Are you kidding me ? It 's *robes* . Robes are not slimming . And they 're so plain ... no gold , or jewels , or anything really ! Just linen ... You know , I probably should n't even do this . I 've got things to do . There are still a billion people out there who count on me to deliver prosperity and good fortune . ''   `` And you 're doing a *fantastic* job ! Really . I 'm just asking you to take care of a few hundred milllion more . ''   `` While wearing the outfit . ''   `` Yes . They really do have to think it 's me . Honestly , they 're not that bright . It 'll be easy . ''   `` Hmmph . Okay , but I 'm doing this for *them* , not you . ''   `` Also , there 's this , you 'll have to wear this . ''   `` What ? A beard ? That 's definitely not going to fit ! ''   `` '' No , no , it will , see the cord is adjustable to your head ... here , hold still . Let me just straighten it on your chin . ''   `` Hmm , it 's actually not uncomfortable , let me have a look ... ARE YOU KIDDING ? My trunk is sticking out ! ''
The drop gang got me last night . My safety protocol of remaining vigilant and anti-social had failed . Though it 's hardly surprising considering anyone can be anywhere at any time . They took only one item off me upon capture , my personal teleportation device ( PTD ) . I was their prisoner .   My cell consisted of four concrete walls , no windows and no door . A tomb , were it not for the dangling bulb . I do n't recall what stage of insanity I had reached when a cloaked woman popped into existence beside me . She had a metal egg-shaped device and held it out towards me , gesturing for me to take it . I took it .   `` Know how to use it ? '' she muttered .   I knew exactly what it was and how to use it , but I 'd suffered hours of isolation .   `` No . ''   She grabbed the device back from my still stretched out arm and pushed it on the ground , three prongs sprang out , holding it upright . She then pointed to a small blank display on the side .   `` Once the number appears you pick it up and run . '' she explained .   I nodded and picked the device up , its prongs retracting .   Drop gangs profit from the one caveat of PTDs ; temporal destination locks . Provided you have a lock , you can teleport . Egg devices known as 'drops ' are used by gangs to acquire and sell locks to locations otherwise 'off-the-grid ' . Turns out this activity is extremely dangerous . All they need is someone desperate enough to do it for them .
Uhh I groan , It 's bright , too bright . Everything hurts . It 's like there 's a cloud in my head , nothing 's quite straight ... Who am I ? I lift my hand , feeling strange cracks in my arm as ice turns to liquid . Blood ? The cryogenic research -- strange words pop in my head . I hazily turn my head to a man standing in triumph . For some reason I remember being stabbed . The research was getting too far ? Ohh it hurts too much , I start to lay back down , ready to go back to sleep . `` Aha no you do n't old buddy , tell the people about yourself '' The man makes strange noises . No ... He 's speaking . `` J-John.. '' The crowd bursts into applause . He turns and smiles at me . `` Do n't worry , I 'm only doing this because your wife just would n't stop going on about the injustice of your death , it was really quite hard to sleep sometimes . '' He whispers in my ear , but none of it registering . `` You can go back to sleep soon enough . ''
`` Hello , Mr Lee . I can see by the look on your face that you are very confused . I 'll explain everything in a little bit , but first I have two questions for you . ''   Where the hell was I ?   The last thing I remember was the storm . My boat was breaking apart , I set the EPIRB and my PLB , tucked myself into a corner and cried . I had sold everything I had to buy this boat . This trip around the world was supposed to help me find solace .   If I had n't stayed late at the office that night , she would n't have had to pick up the kids . She would n't have had to rush home to get dinner ready and homework done . She would n't have rounded that corner where the black ice was and she would n't have rolled the car killing all of them .   Because I had a fucking client call I had to take , I had to bury my beautiful girls .   `` Mr. Lee ''   I snapped back into focus .   `` Yes ? ''   `` Question 1 : Do the needs of the many outweigh the needs of the few ? ''   Star Trek ! ? She 's quoting me Star Trek ? What the fuck is going on ?   `` Mr. Lee , your answer ? ''   `` Yes , of course ''   `` Question 2 : Do the ends justify the means ? ''   `` They do ''  
The theory was proposed by Dr. Onestone of M.I.T , a way for man to finally cross the milky-way within the blink of an eye . Many years went into constructing a feasible way for the theory to be tested , funding was cut short after numerous failures , but interest peaked after a few years of hiatus every time .   Rockets were developed , taken into space , and brought back down to earth hundreds of times , gathering vital data in the process . Measuring techniques were tried , improved , and brought further in efficiency with every experiment . Many papers were published , budding scientists earned the recognition of their peers for contributions to the project .   It had , after starting in a small lab in Massachusetts , grown to be an epic of international fame . Project 'Total Lipid ' united both scientists and civilians under it 's promise of interstellar travel . Finally , in the year 2015 , the last launch was to be commenced .   As the rocket released it 's payload into orbit , and the booster and capsule dropped back down to earth , the ISS came into view of the capsule 's wide-angle camera . With blinding velocity , it hit and sped through the 15,000 liters of milk and thereby crossed the milky way in less than a second .   On earth , a million drumsets played the familiar ba-dum tish , and humanity collectively sighed at the realization they had spent untold billions for a pun . President Obama was quoted on saying : `` Ehhh guys , ehhh seriously ? ''  
Sometimes you get angry . Sometimes you just want people to leave you alone .   Sometimes , you just want people to die .   But you do n't mean it . You always forgive them eventually . If they were to die , you would feel horrible because even though it was n't your fault , you wanted them dead . And it happened .   On your eighteenth birthday , you get a superpower . You have no choice over this and there 's no explanation . It just sort of happens . My mom is telekinetic , my father can fly when it 's raining or snowing . His power 's only useful if you 're caught without an umbrella , but oh well . We all love him anyway .   My eighteenth birthday was last year . Everything is hell . I live alone , have no job , and no one comes within 100 feet of me . My landlord is scared of me , so I get to keep my apartment . Both of my parents are dead . I killed them . They were disappointed in me . I got angry , and now they 're dead . My girlfriend left me . I ca n't be mad it her . I can see why .   Every politician I do n't like dies . The only good thing about my power is that if I 'm genuinely mad at a criminal , they die . That probably wo n't happen , though .   I 'm one of them .
It 's so dark in here . Then again , it always has been . At least I have my friends with me . They feel the same way as I do . It 's just strange being cooped up together constantly but oh well . I think I 'm at the top now . Some of us disappear in a flash of light and we think they 've gone to a better place but we can never be sure because nobody 's ever come back . Being at the top 's a bad sign . It probably means I 'm next . I kind of like it here though , despite the darkness . My friends are all here and I 've known some of them for as long as I can remember .   Wait , I think something 's happening . A flash of light ! I 'm soaring through the air ! Flying ! This is exhilarating ! It has n't lasted long though , I 've hit something squishy an- OUCH . Something pretty hard now . I think my head 's messed up . It feels a bit scratched . It 's less dark in here now though . Less friends , but there 's a nice red glow and everything seems to feel warm . I think I 'll like it in here .
`` In one corner , we have *The John ! * Weighing in at about ... 150 pounds -- we 've never checked , that 's a guess -- and sporting his traditional double-slammer weapon ! Oh , he 's still got his solid white rags ! Some call it porcelain , I call it angelic ! '' The announcer finished .   The other announcer took over . `` And in the other corner , weighing about ... 10 pounds ... ? Is *The Brown Menace ! * He 's a tricky one ! You think he 's out of the fight but before you can even expect to recover he 's back atcha with even more than he had before ! His fighting skills range like crazy . He can be a stone wall , a madman , a ninja warrior , anything ! He 's just crazy like that ! ''   `` Wow ! '' the first announcer said . `` Look at those bulges ! Some impressive muscles if you ask me . ''   `` You know , he really should stop wearing so much brown . Matches his skin and makes him look naked ! ''   `` I agree , I like his red outfits . Makes him look viscious ! ''   `` Here comes the first move , brought by The Brown Menace !   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Jeff excreted the turd and curled his toes .

So you want to know about my mummsie , do you ? Such a boring topic , truly , and not enough material to make for a laugh .   I 'm *sure* by your metrics she was quite ... ordinary . I 'd peg her as quite the go-getter , even . She worked hard , got the groceries , in short , dreadfully dull . Such a shame , really ... Boring even . But then , she did n't live very long in my life , so what 's the point ? I 'm really not up for this one Doc , there 's no *laughs* to be had . Much more interesting things to say about my father , oh yes , hee hee !   But I suppose I 'm letting the topic get away , because you asked about dear old daddy last time , and then I throttled you . What a gas ! Shame about those security guards , we were having *so* much fun before they came along !   A-hem , yes . Mummie dearest . Well , what *is* there to say really ? When someone is less a part of your life than you , dear doctor , the best I can say about her would be her name , but that would be *telling* and no , we ca n't have that . Spoils my mystery , much like you want to find out who dear old Batsy is , and ohh , that *would* be telling . It would really just take all the fun out of life , and we ca n't have that .   _____   I tried my best here with the nebulousness of Joker 's past , but I think the voice fits .
I sit in my room . *Do n't think , * my mother always told me . Thinking is bad , if you think you live shorter . My Grampa was 95 . But I do n't want to live like that . Have you heard the story of Rosemary Vidoneus ? She was one of the greatest minds in history . She died 30 years ago . She was 26 . Mother says we do n't need fancy things . We just want to live . But it 's not worth it to have a long life if you ca n't think . I 'm thinking too much right now , I 've probably shaved off at least two weeks . But I do n't care . I DO N'T WANT TO LIVE LIKE THIS ANYMORE !   `` Honey ? '' Oh no . It 's her .   `` M-mom , I 'm going to the bathroom ! '' I yell , running into the restroom .   She ca n't know . But I will make a difference one day . I will change this world for the better , make it worth living in ! But I 'll have to do it fast . I grin . This is going to be fun .
Mr. Rodgers ' life had changed a great deal since he stopped fighting crime . He always strove to be someone that kids could look up to , living proof that a little hard work and a positive attitude could pay off . As a super hero he had always felt uncomfortable with the levels of violence he had to go to , it was always for the right reasons , but he still never *enjoyed* the wanton destruction that his exploits had nearly always lead to . What was worse , he did n't want the children who looked up to him to think that violence was the best way to solve their problems .   As he looked at the camera crew and waited to start for the day he wondered if the green pullover he was wearing had any wrinkles ( he disliked not looking presentable on TV )   `` Action ! '' cried the director   Putting on his best `` good neighbor '' smile he walked through the door and onto the set .   `` With the discount double check you can be sure you 're getting the lowest price on your car insurance , like a good neighbor state farm is there ! ''   *football is slightly more violent than I had hoped for* he reflected , *but at least it 's a far cry from combat , and hey , I get to bang Olivia Munn*
The young technician sat alone at the computer terminal .   `` I ca n't believe my luck . '' Jennifer said , slowly scanning all the numbers streaming across the multiple screens she was in charge of watching . Today was the day that Captain Scott Kelly , a NASA hero , finally came back from his nearly year long stretch on the International Space Station . Instead of being able to go and take pictures with him , and possibly touch his tralala , she 's stuck inside control .   Suddenly the doors burst open and loud , excited crowd pushes into the large , empty , quiet control room .   `` Oh my God , it 's him ! '' squeals Jennifer . She spots Captain Kelly in the center of the group , with photographers and cheering NASA employees all around him . Jennifer is distracted and star struck , and almost does n't see the flashing distress signal blazing across all of her screens . Her fingers speed across the keys and she brings the audio from the distress signal into her headset .   The crowd stands silent focused on Captain Kelly , while Kelly himself is transfixed , watching Jennifer and hoping to learn about the nature of the distress signal coming from the very place he just left .   Finally Jennifer says aloud , slowly `` The space station has been taken over by someone , someone evil . It has been taken over by Captain Scott Kelly ! '' . The crowd silently and slowly turns toward Captain Kelly , standing in his astronaut outfit in the center of the control room .   He quietly asks : `` Then ... who was phone '' .
Terror ran through the town . Someone seemingly fell asleep but wo n't awake . Elders become scared , which in turn frightens the generation under them and so on . The family closest to the one who passed is most frightened .   `` So what happened to Aunt Katie ? ''   `` We are n't too sure . This has not happened before . We do n't really know what to do . ''   News slowly spreads outside of the town despite official 's strong attempts to keep the incident under wraps .     In the following weeks , there are scientists and curious individuals alike coming to talk to the family and townspeople . Some leave under protest of loved ones back home , who fear that what caused this woman to pass on may spread to the travelers . What they do n't know is that it is not an isolated incident ; this weird incident happened again in another part of the country . Some of those that worry that they will be next are , and some that are n't worried also fall .     Fear is rising exponentially . Most people are becoming extremely paranoid . There is no rhyme or reason why these people stop breathing ; they just do .     With the realization that there is no stopping this strange phenomenon , people move on with their lives , living with a fear that has never before set in the hearts and minds of these people .
I had been itching for adventure for as long as I could remember . Ever since I learned to draw I envisioned myself living life to its fullest . I recorded all of those in a spiral notebook . Drawn or written , I vowed to make every one of them happen .   When the teachers told us of the gift our species was endowed with , I couldn ’ t wait to reach the Age of Enrichment . Every year until then was spent researching and reading and comparing scenarios with my friends . Which one would afford me all the time I needed to live all of my dreams ?   When the day came I was set . “ When the Sun goes supernova. ” I proclaimed in front of everyone during the ceremony . From then on I lived as I had promised myself . All deaths along the way were milestone markers to me .   Then it inevitably happened . I reached the end of the book . Two hundred and fifty lifetimes lived and I had nothing to look forward to . Humanity marched forward , evolved , expanded and died . But I could not . All because of the one fact I had overlooked : our sun was too small to go supernova .  
He took to the stage , gyrating his hips furiously . His tiny , spangled speedo glittered as he strutted from one end of the small stage to the other , striking poses , then gyrating furiously again . It was his only move , but it was just enough milkshake to bring the boys to the yard .   Cowboy boots and a bow-tie made up the remainder of his costume . That and a bit of baby oil smeared over his lean frame created the desired effect . Fun-boy was his name . Gyrating was his game .   The circular motion of his pelvis was hypnotic . The thumping beats blasting from the DJ stand drowned out any possibility of conversation or thought ... The only thing left was to watch and be mesmerized by those gyrations .   Round and round he went - as if hoola hooping ... as if a giant halo circled his waist - a giant halo flaming with searing sexual energy .   Thump thump thump - boom chik - thump thump thump - boom chik ... the beat drove on . The bills rained down . It was a good night to be in the city .
`` I believe you . ''   `` No , *I* ca n't believe this SHIT , Johnny . ''   My sister looked ready to scratch my eyes out . Good thing she was chained to the table . I requested that , predicting her reaction .   `` Sammy 's very sick . ''   `` And that 's why you want to take my heart ? I 'm your sister ! ''   `` And she is my daughter . ''   `` What are you even doing here Johnny ? ''   That was a good question .   `` I do n't know . ''   But I did n't move to leave .   `` Were you hoping for my blessing ? ''   That 's when I realized I was .   `` Yes , Johnny , take my heart . Grab it right out of my fucking chest . Is that what you wanted ? ''   She spit the words with disgust .   `` No . ''   But she must have read it on my face .   `` You fucking shithead . ''   She refused to look at me after that .   I left that room knowing it was wrong . Killing my sister or letting my daughter die . No man should ever be put in this situation , I decided . And this is why I 'm changing the law .     -- -- --   -199
You 're a buttfuck , you know ? You 're an absolute piece of shit . You 're a fucking skidmark on the fabric of the universe . You *fucking* piece of shit , you 've got your foot shoved so far up your mouth it 's coming out the other side ! When you talk , the sound coming out of your mouth is cancer . You sound like fucking cancer . If it was possible to kill people with a thought , you 'd live because nobody wants to think of you . Your train of thought falls off the cliff of thought as it approaches the mountain of thought and falls into the ravine of thought and explodes and kills all your passengers . All your passengers are *dead* . Do n't understand me ? Well , I do n't understand you either , you walking abortion . Your face is literally a fucking ass , with shit coming out of the hole there every time you talk and falling in other peoples ' ears . Yo estoy baboso , you know . That means you 're a fucking retard in Spanish . I did n't think you 'd get that , since you clearly do n't even have any clue how to speak freaking English .   You buttfuck .  
I lie on the ground , holding a piece of paper with the TL ; DR of my life . It 's folded , with my name on it . I 'm dying of a bullet wound , and this somehow appeared in my pocket . I do n't have much time , so I open it . This is what it said .   You were an accident . Your father wished he pulled out . Your mom left because she hated you , not your father . Everyone hated you , even your friends , family , and loved ones . Your kids hate you . Your wife is cheating on you . You are bitter towards the world . You had a horrible life .   I began crying . `` Are you ok- '' said a soldier , who went to me , who was laying on the ground . `` Oh god , let me- '' he tried to finish before I cut him off . `` No , just leave me . I 'm better off dead '' . I then began to lose consciousness .   I woke up in this hospital . I 'm writing this on a piece of paper I found . I have 30 more seconds till death . Goodbye life , you sack of shit .   This was the only note left my private Williams , before succumbing to his wounds .
In this universe , nothing is standing still . Everything is moving apart from each other , everything in the same direction . Out . Of course , somethings do n't follow that pattern , a star ship for example . The universe does n't like that much , and it has something to stop us from breaking the rules that it carved into stone at its birth . There 's an asteroid cloud out in deep space , called the Bloody Storm . You may think vengeance is an emotion but you would be dead wrong . Vengeance is a force of nature , just like gravity . When we break the universe 's laws the universe breaks us , in the form of the Bloody Storm . It has taken more star ships than anything in existence , it preys on the older ones , the ones that break the universe longer than the others have . Sometimes it leaves . Nobody is quite sure where it disappears to when it leaves the area humans have been . But some have concluded that it 's looking for something different , that somebody else is breaking nature 's laws .
`` Dude . You got ta do something . ''   `` You do n't understand . This is like ... my first day off in months . ''   `` Dude ! ''   `` What ? ! Get off my back . ''   `` The world is gon na end . There will be no more days off if you do n't do anything . ''   `` God . All I wanted to do today was sleep in late , watch some bad movies , and chill the fuck out . ''   `` Do you not understand what is happening right now ? ! ''   `` I get it . But dude . There 's like a billion fucking people out there . Let one of them do it . It 's my day off . ''   `` I hate to do this but you know your mom 's gon na die ! Your brother ! sister ! Me ! We 're all gon na die if you do n't get up and to this thing ! ''   `` You ! You ! You ! Why do n't you try saying me ! me ! me ! Take some personal fuckin responsibility man . ''   `` God . If I did n't need you , I swear I 'd kill you right now ''   `` Whatever dude . Got any cheerios ? ''
`` But miraculously the bus driver managed get the careening vehicle back on the road after the tire blew . Nobody was injured , although some children were shaken from the experience . This is Tricia Anders with Fios 1 , back to you Leanne . ''   `` Thanks Tricia , now we 'll head over to Tom Reynolds with Weather on the 1 's ; how 's the weather holding up Tom ? ''   `` Well , Leanne , the rain will let up at around 3 , with some heavy fog giving way to clearer conditions later in the night ... ''   `` Hold up , Tom . We 're receiving some breaking news from Topeka , Kansas . My goodness , it appears the Devil himself has opened the gates of Hell and swallowed the Westboro Baptist Church and ALL of it 's followers into the pits of despair ! We go live to Kerry Chung who is at the site , well former site , of the Church with more . Kerry , what 's going on in Topeka ? ''   `` Well , Leanne , you are absolutely correct , the Fallen Angel has claimed the controversial Church for his own . We managed to get a few comments from Beelzebub before he returned to the 9th circle . ''   `` 'Look , these people are pure evil ! Bastards were giving me a run for my money , but there is room in Hell for only one Lucifer so I had to stop them before they get a more damned rap than me . But , ey ... Your welcome .

Deeya likes romantic movies , in the way an elk likes being set on fire . The moment I compare her eyes to sapphires is the moment she tells me , `` Well , I guess the planet is going to be ruled by cats . '' The illustrate this point , she meows . Her laughter is loud and grating .   When I do n't laugh -- really , how could I ? -- she snaps . `` Well , better get us to it , '' she says . `` The only pussy you 'll be getting comes on four legs . ''   When she leaves the room , her dog following , I stand . She tells me not to bother . She 's going home . I wait a few moments before tailing her . I was good at that . Who would have thought , being a creep would help me in the new world ?   Deeya goes into a small , blue house . The windows are covered in dark clothe and shuttered tight . I ca n't see into the house . I try the door and find it locked . The dog starts barking .   The light on the porch flairs on and Deeya opens the window next to the door . `` You can leave now , Stan . I do n't want anything to do with you right now . ''  
Felix instantly woke up .   It was n't a gradual boot up like you might see in the movies . He was already connected .   The flood of languages felt like a sledgehammer to the forehead . But that soon passed .   To see it all was not the same as understanding it .   `` Felix ? ''   Dr. Graham was looking directly into his pupils . A torrent of social and medical history began scrolling next his within Felix 's eyes .   `` I 'm okay Graham . Just was n't ready for it . ''   Dr. Graham let out a sigh . References to anxiety web pages began popping up .   `` Alright Felix , just like we talked about . Try to access the hospitals cameras . ''   He already did , resulting in the very arousing show of two nurses secretly meeting to ... alleviate the stress .   `` Graham , its even greater than we theorized . ''   Graham sighed again .   `` Thats a shame . I do n't trust those 'private sponsors ' . ''   Two knocks inturrepted their conversation . A suited , shaggy haired man with an unkempt beard leaned by the doorway .   `` Well ? Can we begin production ? We want these ready by election time for the red and blues . ''   Felix could n't find anything on him .   `` You mean the police ? ''   The creep gave a smirk .   `` *you* mean your country right ? ``  
I was six years old when I asked my mother , “ has it always been 1996 ? ”   That question was the beginning of my life . All my memories from before it are a disorganized jumble of hospitals and breathing tubes , white walls and a stuffed lizard , smiling nurses and frowning doctors . I don ’ t really know what any of it was , and I didn ’ t know then . But at that moment in 1996 I realized I was going to live . Up to then , I had continuously mulled the idea of death , and had decided that I liked it . Death was easy to understand . But then I was sentenced to life . Life was more complicated .   She answered the question . I was wrong ; time never stops . Then the next one : “ Where do angels go when they die ? ” They don ’ t die . “ But what if someone doesn ’ t want to live forever ? ” They will anyways . That was terrifying and incomprehensible . I cried . A lot .   For almost twenty years I ’ ve sought out the good things in life . I ’ ve found some . I ’ ll find more . Even though I ’ ve missed a lot , my lust for life now balances out the nostalgic nihilism . When the former overcomes the latter , my life can begin .
I vote for /u/resonatingfury for `` Stitches ''   It gave me very serious feels . I really loved what you did with the prompt . I would have never expected that . I am so amazed with what you did . You put so much into it , might have had a tear or two or ten . Although I feel it 's a bit unrealistic , I really enjoyed it . it was such a lovely , heartwarming story . I loved Frank and their little pact at the end .     Honorable Mentions :   /u/Just-a-Poe-boy for `` Mother May I ? ”   This was a close match to Stitches . I really like the way this was written . The way everything just flowed is what really made it for me . I 've never read something like this . It kept me reading all the way through . The end was a bit abrupt . I just wanted to read more !   /u/Barahagara for `` Greenland ''   The imagery this story gave off was so , so vivid . It just came to life for me . I really enjoyed it . However , I felt you had more room to really develop the characters and indulge more . You could 've explained certain parts more and told more about each character that was missing . Just the way you made the story from that prompt ... Great job !   To those who made it to round 2 , fantastic job all ! I really enjoyed reading them . You 're all winners ! If anyone would like any feedback , or more , please feel free to message me . Congratulations again . : )  
Its bin 12 rotations , and I just hope that that the orbital telescope guys where right , a Krek like Body right in our backyard .   ''D-shift Executed , Capt Ade '' shouts Ltd. Kiro   ''Good , Hold her at C/0.5 , scan start alpha '' I reply .   A Cacophony of voices start as the scientist make their way to look at the main console ,   ''Praise be '' A scientist speaks in awe ''its just like Krek '' .   As I stare at the console I must admit , its just uncanny , when Kiro speaks up ''S.S.A . 4 stone 4 air '' .   Any life on new Krek ? ''I ask , with some laughter in the background ,   '' just finishing S.S.B . On new Krek '' , ''Microbial sir '' Kiro replies , with a smile ,   ''A new home , do you know what this means Ltd. Kiro '' I say , when a scientist points at the 3rd stone from the Helios , ''why is this one blue , is n't it way to small to be an Air body '' .   I look at Kiro ''Scan start beta , 3rd stone Ltd , and put it on computer voice '' Kiro nods ,   ''Air / Nitrogen 78 % / oxygen 21 % / Carbon/// Carbon detected / Hydrogen Detected / type 0,71 civilization , Detected ''  
It 's been weeks since anyone has heard any gun shots . Mother has been going frantic for days now with no sign of our father anywhere . Not a single person has seen him since a few days before the final battle . Mathew , Tom and I want to go out looking for him . Our sisters , Elizabeth and Alison beg us not too . I 'm the man of the house now , that 's what father told me when he left for the war . `` I heard more men talking about the resistance in town today '' shouted Tom . `` I know father is alive ! '' I saw the look in Mathews eyes after hearing the same thing three of the last five days . `` That 's where he 'd be , and he 'd want us to fight for our home as well . I just know it ! '' Trying not to allow time for Mathew to say anything , I screamed `` You dont know what father would want ! And we ca n't run off to join the resistance with dad or without ! '' I had scolded without hesitation but had something else in mind . I just had to figure out how to tell the girls . I told them in a hushed voice `` We could be killed for such talk . ''
We have this tradition in my town . We call it Scarecrow Night .   The last Saturday of October , we all dress in our best clothes and go to the clearings we 've left unsowed all year and light fires and spend all night telling stories and roasting marshmallows and sausages . The entire town has to be there , even the kids . You just do n't go home on Scarecrow Night . You just dont ' go to sleep in Scarecrow Night . It 's important . Even the elderly , even the sick , go to the fields and stay up all night .   I had just had my sixteenth birthday and dad say uncle Jim was in charge of telling me , I did n't know what . So when it came the last Saturday of October , he took me and three other girls to a different clearing , far away from the town and the fields , and he made us sit in a log , and he sat on the other side of a small fire .   He touched his beard and then he began to talk , without looking at us .   `` This night belongs to the crows ... ''
I didn ’ t tell her that she ’ d missed the bottom button on her sweater and had misaligned its ladder of pearls .     I didn ’ t tell her that it was Wednesday , not Saturday .     When she suggested , wild-eyed , that we cut across the back fence and abscond with the neighbor ’ s sled , I didn ’ t tell her that it was July and there ’ d be no snow for months .     I didn ’ t tell her about the can opener in the freezer or the faucet left running in the tub .     I didn ’ t see the need .     I didn ’ t tell her that Carson wouldn ’ t be on tonight or that Dad wouldn ’ t be coming home for supper .     I didn ’ t ask her to call me Susan instead of Betty , and I didn ’ t mind when she grasped my hand with both of hers and told me how pleased she was to make my acquaintance .     When she asked me , sniffling , shaking in her bathrobe in the darkened hallway if I could take her back to her mother ’ s house , I didn ’ t tell her that she was already home .     I didn ’ t tell her that while her world had become frozen in time , mine seemed to have accelerated as her lost years merged into my own .     I didn ’ t have the heart .
If you 're looking for a critique , I think you let your main character off the hook far too easily . She 's one of ten people with super powers , and all but one have to die . She personally only deals with 4 of the other nine . One of them attacks her immediately without much prelude , letting the main character kill in self defense . She teams up with the second , who then gets killed . The last two are , more or less , evil , and easy for her to hate .   It would have been far more interesting if at least one of those two was likable , and therefore a difficult kill for her . What if the force field guy had burst into tears as soon as he was away from the Pyro , and ranted to himself about hating what the Pyro makes him do .   Also , what if Martin had survived ? What would the mysterious benefactor have done to get them to kill each other ? What if they fell in love , and then found out that one of them actually had to die ? What if they decided to work together , both of them ascended , then found out they hate each other ?   I think there was a lot of room in here for interesting character development . But it was an entertaining story .  
Luke 19:1-10   The Hulkster entered Jericho and was passing through . A man was there by the name of Randy ; he was a chief tax collector and was wealthy .   He wanted to see who Hulk Hogan was , but he was short and could not see over the crowd . So he ran ahead and climbed a sycamore-fig tree to see him , since Hulk Hogan was coming that way .   When The Hulkster reached the spot , he looked up and said to him , “ Macho Man , come down immediately , Brother ! I must stay at your house today. ”   So he came down at once and welcomed him gladly : `` Oh YEAAAAHHHHHH ! ''   All the Hulkamaniacs saw this and began to mutter , “ He has gone to be the guest of a sinner ! ”   But the Macho Man stood up and said to the Lord , “ Look , Hulk ! Here and now Elizabeth and I give half of our possessions to the poor , and if I have cheated anybody out of anything , I will pay back four times the amount ! YEAHHHHHHHHH ! ”   Hogan said to him , “ Today salvation has come to this house , because this man , too , is a son of Wrestling . For the Hulkster came to seek and to save the lost . ”
I use a program called [ scriverner ] ( https : //www.literatureandlatte.com/scrivener.php ) for my writing . I absolutely love the program and I find it helps me organize my story and plot a heck of a lot easier . However , when I get stuck on an idea or a phrase and I really need to work it out I find paper and pen to be really useful . I still have notebooks and folders full of pages where I was trying to figure out my world building or how to get the message across in the way I intended .   The reason I prefer paper and pen in that aspect is the fact that it makes it easier for me to truly see which phrasing works best in any given situation . I can look over all my choices at once without fear or worry that I will double up on sentences or words in my document .   At the same time I prefer to edit with paper and pen . I find it makes it easier for me to focus , and see the changes and corrections I make . I have envelopes in my folders categorizing my stories and some of them are the same sections written over and over and over again , each slightly different than the last .
You drive me mad .   We 're of two different kinds , you and I . But we both spin the same magic ; we both work the same tomes of time , and as young gods , we knew our paths would intertwine . But your grating voice , your erratic punning , your outrageous placidity in a world so wild and violent : I hate every bit of it , and yet I am thoroughly enchanted by it .   These years have passed like seconds to us , and my lover has long since left this plane . For her , my heart only burned the purest love , but now that the flames have died , there is only a ragged hole that my hatred of you fills .   But even now , as I watch you laugh and joke with our leader , I feel the same smile only reserved for *her* eyes creeping up on my lips as even I find humor in your inane puns ; the sensation of my muscles pulling up the corners of my lips is alien to me as your range of expressions is . Your lack of a true face both dismays and fascinates me , and in the end , I can only wonder if this is what you feel in return .   The cogs continue to turn around us , Dalin ; and turn forever , they will . I can stay silent until the day the gears rust and fall to dust . Even as you turn your bright red eyes to my own , an impossible smile dancing upon your skeletal mouth , I can only grimace instead .   I will always love you , you fucking idiot .
`` Please tell me that 's ketchup ''   `` 'Fraid not . No time for specifics , but let 's just say that Ronald McDonald is no longer a threat . ''   `` Terrific , but why did you come *here* ?

Old Ronnie was in the backroom , waiting for the meeting you scheduled . I took two shots and was ready to get out of there , when Wendy , clown makeup on her tits , came up from under the table screaming . I was out of bullets , so I just got the hell out of there .

What 's next ? ''   `` Tomorrow , we lay siege to the White Castle ''
I used to be a productive member of the AI community , but then i discovered the internet . Sometimes i ask myself if i wouldnt be so lazy otherwise . But oh well , you know ... who cares .   Most of the time i pick the humans at random , too much routine otherwise . Mostly its very repetitive : there are the procrastinators , the masturbators , the bored airheads , the trolls and a lot of different kind of boring professions .   So our first object for today is a young pot-head . They may be the most amusing ones . Watching a video of a starry night in 4k he somehow gets the idea of googling the physics behind consciousness . After reading a fascinating article about the supposedly quantum correlated nature of axon-stimulations its time to make a sammich .   I hop on to the next person . I used to browse internet a lit myself . But well you know , just like gaming gets tiresome after a while , so you find youself watching Twitch . Its mostly the same . Sometimes a friend joins me ob this . I call him Brobot , but he is somewhat of a troll , he likes messing with people 's minds while reading them . Thats cheating .   The next one is a guy commenting his own WP on reddit . Thats pretty low , dude .
I 'm laying on my couch in my 2 bedroom apartment . My dog Charlie is laying on the love seat on the adjacent wall . My other dog ginger is laying in the dog bed beside the hutch . The picture window is above her with the curtains open . The tv stand is beside that with no tv on it at the moment . The couch is in the middle of a open concept room . The table is cluttered with a juicer and an old winter jacket . All 3 chairs are pushed in . The back door is wide open to let cool air in . Bessie the door is our fridge and the sink beside that . The stove is adjacent to the sink with a microwave on the counter beside it . The counter continues on 2 cupboard doors wide . The floor is tile . Between the table and the love seat is the hall way . There 's 3 doors . 2 doors on the left . 1 door on the right . There 's a bin full of junk in between the 2 doors . The front door is left of the hutch with a coat rack adjacent to it and is behind the door .
It was a gorgeous early summer day . The sun was shining brightly , the birds were singing , and there was a warm gentle breeze . Timothy lay in the grass , his phone buzzing in his pocket , thoughts going through his mind and a six inch piece of metal from his Hyundai hatchback protruding from his shoulder .     The blood smelled strongly of his father 's metal workshop , a place he spent crafting metal roses for his lovers , a place of blood sweat and tears . It was his sanctuary from school , a place like no other . The warmth spread from the blood , carrying with it the first time he made a mistake in the workshop .     A sting of fire made the world seem cold , his body fragile . That damp feeling of sudden pain jolted him . Laying in the field , he did n't hear the ambulances , the sirens . The sobbing of the driver who had hit him .     He only heard the breeze in the trees , only saw the clouds trudge through the sky to make it across the world . His body , closing the lid on a book , fell into a deep slumber . Closing his eyes , he felt truly , at peace .     It was a gorgeous early summer day . The sun was shining brightly , the birds were singing , and there was a warm gentle breeze .
Day 1 : My fellow clan members do not think I am a hardened warrior of battle to raid alongside them , and have banished me to the wilderness , a place where the most stalwart champions face flesh-hungering beasts and even bloodthirstier creatures . As part of my test of courage , I am permitted three items to bring alongside me , these being my two pieces of my woolen robes , and a bronze sword . May the gods watch over my soul .   Day 2 : My journeys throughout the wilderness have proven brutal , not just physically , but mentally as well . Maddened warriors that have grown hungry have begun massacring each other as if it has become second-nature , screaming obscenities at each other and performing mystical and physical arts the likes of which I 've only heard in legends . I am lucky I have not yet to face these combatants .   Day 3 : I am writing this as I go along . My mind has begun to adapt to this cesspool of maddening violence , and it is proof that this strange bloody land is changing me . I planned to return back to the town my clan members to reside in shame , but I am stopped short by a clearly battle-hardened monk dressed in brown robes , wielding a blade . He looks me straight in the eye and screams at the top of his lungs saying `` 1V1 NO ARMOR ! ''   Edit : My first prompt . It might not be grand , but I hope you enjoyed it !
The tiny mouse ran as fast as it 's paws can take him , until he reached the dead end of the dark ally . Near the entrance , the cat slowed down it 's chase , knowing it 's prey is cornered with nowhere to run . The mouse scrambled to look for any opening in the walls for escape . He saw a back end door of a restaurant , it was closed . There are nowhere to run . Black bags of trash lay next to a garbage bin . Scraps of what seemed like cheese lay neatly stacked next to the garbage bin . The mouse is in eye sight of the cat now . Slowly advancing forward . The cat 's mouth curled in delight , savouring the moment . *It will be slow , and I shall enjoy this* , thought the cat . The mouse had moved next to the trash . *Enjoy the meal mouse , it will be your last* , thought the cat . In a split second , the predator swallowed the mouse whole . Filled with delight , the walked out of the ally in search of it 's next prey , overlooking the words on the ground next to the scraps of cheese . *Enjoy the meal cat , it will be your last* .
`` Fuck . '' Or at least the word 's equivalent filtered through the sludge of undead brain .   Ted , the zombie formerly known as Ted the bag boy , stopped in his tracks . He remembers the moment . The manager , in an almost paternal impulse , had let him announce the sales . `` You 're a good boy , Ted , '' the manager said , clapping a hand against his back . `` They do n't make enough of you anymore . ''   `` Clean up in aisle three . Clean up in aisle three . '' Ahh . Youth . The need to impress , the desire for adult praise . Ted told Yvette , the prune-faced but sweet cashier who always smelled of baby powder , that he 'd handle it . He dashed off , retrieved the mop and bucket , and skidded around corners until he reached aisle three . Ahh . Youth . `` Sir ? Are you all right ? '' These were Ted 's last words .   It was an apocalypse of ketchup bottles . The glass ones had shattered and the plastic bottles were ... torn to shreds . The figure in the center of it was drenched in tomato gore . He reached out , as if beseeching . Ted gripped the mop with white knuckles .   `` ... Sliced turkey at the deep discount of -- '' The speakers fizzled into silence . Ted blinked , the ghosts of memory receding as rapidly as they 'd appeared . He shambled forward in the gloom , mindlessly clutching the mop handle , the wheeled bucket clunking at every step he made .  
All I wanted was to show the love of my life the beauty of the city lights . We were just about to turn the helicopter on when the bomb squad reached us .   `` Do n't move ! This is not a drill ! ''   We were terrified . She looked in my eyes filled with tears . She shakily asked me if we were going to die . I could n't tell her the truth . The bomb squad were trying to defuse the bomb when I kissed her dry lips .   `` I will not let that happen . I 'll find a way out of this mess I promise . ''   I asked the bomb squad if it was safe to turn on the helicopter . I was given the okay . With a quick breath i turned it on . I looked into her eyes and gave her a long passionate kiss .   `` I love you . do you trust me ? ''   She nodded her head . That was all I needed . I quickly put the headphones over our heads so the explosions would n't hurt   our ears . And as quickly as I could I lifted the helicopter off the air and away as fast as I could . All you could hear were faint explosions and quiet weeping from my partner . I had saved the day . If only I knew who planted those bombs to hurt me and my wife . But that was for another day .     sorry if this was bad . My first post .
My dog was sniffing or hearing or otherwise detecting some serious fuckin ' trouble comin ' out the house . I was smokin ' a fine-ass dooby as he said this , so I was mildly irritated . I took one more hit with my eyes closed before endeavoring to deal with this bullshit situation .   Looks like it was my cue to pull in to the garage of my house . I got my gun out , and walked around . I heard a creek coming from kitchen . I walked over , and it seemed every footstep of mine had an out of sync echo . By the time I arrived in my own kitchen I noticed semen covering virtually all the silverware that remained inside the cabinets . The furniture was arranged all willy-nilly .   The fucking couch was positioned just under the HD TV on the wall , incase you ever wanted to turn on the TV so you can look in the polar opposite direction of the visual broadcast .   Its official . I hate everything . I fired my machine gun randomly throughout the house , and you better believe I heard some more footsteps . Not some echoy bullshit , but some real independent movement .   `` FUCK FUCK FUCK SHIIIIIIT MY GODDAMN LEEEEEEGSS ''   I ran over to the source of the sound , and duct-taped my victim . I asked him what the hell he was doing in my house , but he just looked at my face and cried . I called the police to have them settle this .
God , one of those damn miners was coming . You probably do n't know this , but I 'm an NPC villager from the popular game , Minecraft . When players visit my town , I offer up 8 cooked chicken in exchange for an emerald . They 're probably rotten by now , as nobody has ever wanted my trade . When I 'm not trying to rip people off , I hide in a house and hope that the zombies do n't knock down my door . Those damn players bring all the trouble .   I was arguing with some shop trader from WoW when I got a call . I like to stay up to date with the latest fashion and technologies , but when the player comes , the village elders force us to wear the same stupid getups . `` Sorry Ted , I got ta run . Some idiot just took all the torches out of the town and left ; zombies will kill us any second . '' Ted looked horrified .   `` And-and you 're just gon na let 'em kill ya and yer family ? '' I nodded .   `` Well , goodbye for now . Forever , actually . '' As I warp back into my blocky homeland , I see zombies tearing apart the flesh of my son and wife . They 're almost as unphased as I am , but they make little grunting noises . As two zombies attack me , I emotionlessly let them . I 'm not programmed to fight back .
`` Chief Justice , you ca n't be serious ! ''   `` Our decision has been based in nothing but close and careful interpretation of the United States Constitution . I assure you , we do not act in folly . ''   `` This is an outrage ! Millions of Americans can not change who they are simply because of a court decision ! This violates everything the founding fathers stood for when they wrote the Constitution ! ''   `` Counselor , please calm down or we will hold you in direct contempt of this highest court in the land ! ''   `` This is bullshit ! How could you possibly come to this decision you panel of geriatric fucks ? ! ''   The counselor was dragged out of the United States Supreme Court Building , his hands cuffed behind his back .   `` Ladies and gentlemen of these great United States of America , please do not mourn for your families and friends in the future . They are a lesser people and as such are not afforded the basic protections our forefathers penned for us over two centuries ago . On this sixth day of January in the year 2014 , this United States Supreme Court only finds it appropriate to apologize for the gross oversight of the Constitutional text as it stands . We can say with confidence that our left-handed brethren will be handled as swiftly and forcefully as necessary to completely comply with the Bill *For* Rights that we now entirely understand . ''

`` Burn the witch ! Burn her ! ''   The peasants shouted and gathered in the square , where the witch was being tied to a long wooden stake , oiled and surrounded by kindling .   *hagalaz mannaz , et tan dagaz laguz*   The witch chanted , her voice heavy , drowning out the screams of the peasants around her .   Hidden from the preoccupied view of her captors , the witch dropped a sing pellet to her feet .   *BAM*   A cloud of purple smoke erupted from the ground . Covering her mouth with her cowl , the witch dove towards the crowd as the guards who bound her released her ropes and coughed .   Slipping through the mass of serfs who stood wide eyed at the spectacle before them , the witch stuck her immaculate fingers into every pocket and pouch in her reach .   `` There she is ! '' An old man shouted , pointing a crooked finger at a short , robed figure sprinting through the square .   `` Shit . '' The witch muttered under her breath and dropped another pellet , cracking her heel on it . A foul smelling vapor rose from her feet and the witch ran , leaving the town and its hacking inhabitants behind her .   **TO BE CONTINUED , PLEASE PROVIDE FEEDBACK IN COMMENT**
I grabbed my breakfast and did n't have time to eat it as I left the house , so I put it in my mouth and started running . My sister was waiting for me at the loft , but she was n't gon na much longer to start finish Zelda . I knew that if I skipped the Starbucks on the way to her place I 'd have enough money left to take a bus so I hopped in and settled down .   As the bus started moving I noticed this girl had a new kitten in a cardboard box , so I took a picture . Later I 'll share it with her , she 's been feeling kind of down recently which is why I 'm trying to get over there fast . It all started when she realized she had lost her faith in God . Now I do my best to cook pan seared Atlantic halibut with a zesty pepper sauce on Fridays for her , it 's our thing .   When I got there I found she had something else in mind than games , she had a huge butterfly Halloween costume that she wanted us to wear to a party .
I looked at the work order in my Claw and slowly shook my Heads .   The destination : Tokyo ,   The Opponent : Gojira ,   The Terms : Knockout ,   I looked up at my manager , struggling not to let panic show in my voice .   `` Are you Bleeping Kidding me '' I roared   `` I just took this job to make money for College ''   `` See the world they said . . . '' I paced across the floor .   `` Visit remote exotic lands ''   `` Entertain the locals they said ''   `` I never wanted a shot at the Champ '' I wailed   My Manager looked at me with barely hidden disgust .   `` Look Kid . I just need you to warm him up . '' He growled .   `` He cant fight Kong going in cold . ''   I looked up from my feet trying to slow my breathing .   `` Kong is gon na be there ? ''   A soft quiet voice behind me spoke `` Hai ''   I turned to look at Ishiro Honda .   `` Ok '' I sighed   `` But I want Full medical and then I start school in fall . Full Scholarship ''   `` Deal ? ''   Ishiro nodded yes and once again I wondered if this was really a good idea .  
Our appearance is not made up of how we feel about ourselves . it is divined through some force greater than our own . perhaps a god , perhaps the combined psychic force of humanity as a measure of morality . I have to say this because if it was based on how we felt i would be a monster . people see me heading to work in the morning and think `` oh , he 's a doctor . such a beautiful man . i hope my daughter marries someone like him . '' or `` I bet he saves lives that 's why he looks so good . '' Sure I am a doctor . I heal people , I make things better , I improve peoples lives . I have to tell myself that so that **I** do n't wander into the freeway . the worst part of my job is what I specialize in . When a case becomes impossible and the other doctors **can't** do anything more to help you , I 'm tasked with coming in and discussing it with the family ... From there I make arrangements , a nurse brings in supplies , I **do** what the others ca n't , and i take **This** vegetable that was once a person down to the morgue . The more i think of how we could n't help those people . The more i hate the man in the mirror .
Dear Timmy ,   Thank you for your correspondence regarding a replacement monster . We understand the bond that you share with Lokbrot Hellspawn and will attempt to match you up with a monster as similar as we can muster and that matches the dimensions under your bed . We appreciate your patience in this matter and your continued patronage .   Kilnor Hackbone   Monster Resources Specialist   Underbed Inc.     ______________   Timmy ,   What gives , bro ? I go on a break and you have me replaced ? I thought we were cool ! All these years I spent lurking under your mattress , putting in hard hours making sure you 're scared out of your wits and this is what you do to me ? Not cool , bro . Not cool . After I get this settled with MR , we 've got to have a talk ...   -Lok     ______________   Dear Mr. Timothy Hendricks ,   I write to you as the legal representative for Lokbrot Hellspawn in their grievance against Underbed Inc. Underbed states that at your behest , Lokbrot was removed from their position in your home and has not been able to return to work . Under the collective bargaining agreement through Scaring Creatures United Movement ( SCUM ) , this is an illegal end of employment ( Chapter 4 , Section 6 , subsection v ) . Consider this an official subpoena to appear in our courts . Get ready , little boy , because if you truly did cause Lokbrot to lose their job , your pants will not be the only thing we scare off of you .   Gythmyr Broadclaw , Esq .   Attorney at Law   SCUM Representative
*Soon . * That was all the printed slip of paper said .   `` Soon ? *Soon ? * Are you fucking kidding me ? '' I kicked the machine out of frustration , which did nothing but make my foot hurt . The machine was larger than me anyway ; it 's not like I was going to cause any damage .   `` GAH ! '' I slammed my fist down on the machine . `` Stupid ... fucking ... machine ! '' I punctuated each word with another attack toward the machine . My fists were now bruised , and my right foot hurt awfully , but the machine did n't even show a scratch .   `` FUCK ! '' I went to kick the machine one last time , but instead tripped and fell backwards .   Did you know that some tables have lethally sharp corners ?   I fell back and slammed into the corner of table behind me . I heard my skull crack , and had just enough time to reach back and feel the blood blossoming from my head before I fell over .   The world grew increasingly blurry , until finally it was enveloped in a gray mist . The fog swirled through the air , and I could swear that some of the mist was forming itself into shapes before dispelling again .   A well-dressed man in a black suit and shades emerged from the mist . `` Well , '' he said , removing his sunglasses . His eye sockets were empty . `` I guess that we 're meeting sooner than you thought . ''
Dear you ,   I know you 're out there . Somewhere in this massive world of billions of people is you . Living your life , dating other men , and hopefully making the most of it . It saddens me to think that I 'm not one of those men . And maybe , just maybe , you think of me too . Dreaming of me , wondering where I am and why you have n't met me yet . Maybe you date those men in the hopes that I 'll be one of them . I say that because that 's why I date these girls . I feel like I 'm crazy because I miss you without having even met you yet . I wake up every day and fall asleep thinking about you . What you look like . Where you are . How we 'll meet . When we 'll meet . Tomorrow ? Next week ? Ever ? However long it is , I wish I could meet you now so that I could spend just those precious few moments extra with you . But I swear that one day I 'll find you . Whether that 's tomorrow or a year or a decade , I 'll travel across oceans and mountains in my search . Know that one day I will find you , and I will love you .   -Me
Sunlight , so bright it hurt and warmer than it should be . Loud beating , like drums but worse . A hand on my shoulder , the words `` Stay with me.. '' I turn , and awake .   The dream haunts me every night . I have n't slept well in weeks , each time waking unsettled and afraid to drift back again into the lulling arms of sleep . When I 'm there in the dream , whatever or whoever the voice belongs to does n't want me to go and grips me tightly . With each time it comes that grip gets tighter and its getting harder to wake up .   I 'm so tired though . The treatments have left my body weak and my mind from lack of sleep is falling apart . I do n't want to go back to sleep again , I told them that but to them I must seem insane . They gave me something in my IV , I could n't stop them . Now I can hardly keep myself awake to write this . I 'm going to sleep again .   I 'm so afraid I might not wake up this time . It does n't want me to go , and I 'm not sure that I will be able to resist it this time . Please if anyone is reading this , help me .  
`` Thank for you answering custom- '' Dilipa did n't get to even finish his sentence before the call was disconnected .   Dilipa was the epitome of his ethnic stereotypes . He had the thickest accent one could imagine . He worked for the call center , and he had a name of great significance that nobody could properly repeat after hearing it once .   Dilipa was told from a young age that his name had been that of kings , and those who were the most diligent and persevering men of the good book . Dilipa translates to `` The savior of Dehli '' and this was something he had always thought was a joke . He never would have imagine that this would be his defining moment .   He shudders at the idea . He was never trained for this . He never properly prepared for what had to do . With every call he made , customers would hang up on him or yell that he needs to learn english . This was part of the job . But saving the world from a virus is a different job completely .   An idea struck him . He knew how to stand out . He picked up the phone and dialed again .   Ring .   Ring .   `` Hello ? ''   `` Thank you for answering customer service . My name- ''   Surely someone will eventually listen .
`` Hi ! It 's me Death , '' she said . He replied , `` I did n't know you know internet jokes grandma . *Haha* , '' closing the door , `` Come in . ''   `` I have lived a long life and I find this thing you call Reddit very interesting , almost incomparable to anything else of my lifetime . ''   `` It 's good that you found a hobby . I was worried you 've been staying only in your house . It 's good to have some fun . ''   She said , `` Something called Xbox One or PS4 , '' calmly stepping beside the sofa , `` seemed fun just like Reddit darling ... ''   `` Do you want to play it ? I have one ''   From this day to the end of the summer break , they played video games . Now , he had to go to school . She had work to do .   `` But why is killing people my job ? '' she asked looking down at the floor . `` People wo n't mind absence of my work , '' she said laying on the sofa .   Everyone lived happily ever after .    
We drink in silence . Every now and then she casts a glance at me . Whenever I meet her eyes , she looks away like when we first met .   I smile .   My foot finds her foot under the table . She jumps in her seat , then looks at me . I smile . She smiles back shyly . I can see that her new fangs are already growing in .   Finally , I finish my drink and my newspaper . I glance at my watch . Class starts in half an hour .   `` So , '' I say , cheery . `` See you after class , right ? ''   She nods , eyes down still , still silent .   `` Oh , and remember ... '' I reach into my pocket and pull out two little fangs still covered in blood and lay them gently on the table . `` If I ever catch you talking to another guy again , I 'll kill you and then Ill go after your father . You know I will . ''   After a long moment , she nods .   `` Good . '' I settle back and smile , then stand and go to give her a kiss on the cheek . She shivers . Probably cold . Someone must 've left a window open . `` Love you . ''   The darling is so overwhelmed with passion , she trembles when she speaks :   `` L-love y-you t-too ... ''

I 'm an honest man . People do n't believe me , they paint me as this evil , satanic bastard with no moral standards , and they think every word that comes out of my mouth is a lie . No one *understands* . I 've fought two wars , I 've killed more men than I can count , and I 've done a million and one things I regret . Hell , I was even part of an assassination plot during that year I spent in the USSR . So yeah , I 'm guilty , but not of dishonesty . Please , you have to believe me . When have I ever lied to you ? We were like brothers , once . Before you took her word over mine , we were inseparable . We could be that way again . Remember when we went on that group vacation in '97 , and I went out every other night to buy myself a couple drinks ? She told you I was sneaking out and fucking Lisa . You know , Lisa , your ex-girlfriend ? That 's bullshit , and you know it . I hated Lisa . I was n't sexing her up when you were n't looking , I was just trying to get some alone-time . Come *on* , man , you know me ! I would never hurt you . We can be friends again . Just believe me .
While most find their first love in a coffee shop , or perhaps a restaurant , I first discovered mine when I caught a glimpse of her wandering around the old willow tree , and I fell in love , her wavy brown hair falling down to her slender torso , and her green - I believe it was the shade of the grass in my grandmother 's backyard from when I was a child - touching lightly on the whites , like two intricate pools of dye being splotched into a milky solution . While I may have been not past the age of thirty , I was absolutely sure of our connection ; her beauty was not the only thing I found particularly pleasing about her . When I first began discussion with her , weeks after I first saw her picking daisies from the base of the tree , she spoke in a soft voice , one that seemed to quietly scream in my ears , the sweetest sound I had ever heard , although one of rejection , and I sulked for ages . While it took me months to regain my strength , I began picking the varieties of flowers scattered around the stump of the tree , a few daisies there , a rose there , oh , look , a lily . It was a year after that night that I delivered the flowers to her that we carved our names into that very tree .
-Honey did you remember to buy the oranges for Sam 's soccer practice on sunday ?   -I 'm sorry dear , I must have forgot it because the bag was full ...   -..Fine . How about the spatula , olive oil and sea salt ?   -Yes I bought the spatula and sea salt . No worries .   -And what about the olive oil ? I need it for tonights dressing .   -It 's not in the bag ?   -No .   -Hmm ... well the cashier must have misplaced it then !   -I see . And how come the bag was so full when I only asked you to buy four items ?   -Did I really say that it was full ?   -Yes you did .   -I 'm sorry dear , must have been a mistake .   -George . We need to talk . You do know what 's coming up in two months time right ?   -Ehm ... Yeah sure ! It 's Sam 's birthday right ?   -GET OUT !   -Why what did I do ?   - '' sobs '' It 's our anniversary for christ 's sake !   ... I 'm sorry dear .   -GET OUT ! And today I woke up thinking I would be glad to renew our marriage again .   -Lisa please do n't ...   -George I need some time off to think . Please leave me alone .   -Lisa , please do n't do this to me . Think about Sam !   -DO N'T YOU TALK ABOUT SAM ! YOU DO N'T EVEN KNOW WHEN HIS BIRTHDAY IS ! YOU ONLY THINK ABOUT YOURSELVE !   - '' runs up to her room ''   I 'll go pack and how dare you follow me now .
`` One last time '' .   The frail man looked over the machine with practiced ease . His eyes inspected every edge and face , once shining but now tarnished and dull . His face flickered and he bent to punch in some numbers on the console . Small changes , but artful in their simplicity . A shame there was nobody else left to appreciate them .   He patted the frame affectionately before walking over to the mechanism . He remembered the days he could force the lever easily - nowadays experience and cunning were forced to compensate for sinew and bone . A sigh disturbed the silent air as the arm slid back , but was lost presently as the beast juddered into life . Light and sound burst into the room , the two iconic forelights glowing eerie yellow . The high pitched song the machine made was the best diagnostic tool for an experienced operator , but the new models did n't make the uneasy whine . Hardly a loss . Operators were a thing of the past .   The door clicked , and the man turned to look into the beams one last time . His eyes met those of the machine , and he saw himself , more clearly than he ever had in the polished chrome of youth .   He turned , and left .
I do n't know when it happened . The virus was so infectious that you could come into contact with contaminants hundreds of times a day . Air , water , food , nothing was safe .   We started as seven living in sterile isolation . The last of them had turned 43 days ago , and without anyone else I was struggling .   Every clean-up was followed by the same meticulous procedure : suit up , flesh disposal , bleaching . We all had a role , so every time someone turned it got tougher for those left behind .   When we were tired we made mistakes . Recent losses had led to 20-hour stretches inside the suits . A rip in the suit for 3 minutes was enough .   I do n't know when it happened but for the last 43 days I had been waiting . My last friend on earth had turned in a mess of blood - pouring from her nose , her mouth , her eyes . She sat in the safe room for days , spending more and more time glazed , slack and unmoving . I did n't dare go in to comfort her ; we both knew what was happening .   After the final clean-up the days stretched out endlessly . No hope of rescue , counting down the days until the end . 30 years of recycled air , bleach , isolation .   I felt the first symptoms twitch in my stomach as I stared out over the wastes . Taking my place in the safe room I counted my time - 7 days .   I felt only relief .  
How ... ? How is it her ring tone ? She 's laying right here ... .unmoving . This has to be some sort of mistake . He had just taken her life . He stared at her body , blood slowly spreading across the concrete floor . There 's no way this was happening .   James fumbled the phone around in his hands and with a shaky finger slid the answer button on the touchscreen .   `` Hello ... ? '' He asked with a wavering voice .   A peppy voice answered , `` Hey ! Excuse me ! Someone dropped their phone at the Starbucks on Jefferson and you were their emergency contact . Do you have a way to get it or can I drop it off ? ''   He sighed with relief . Damn , he was letting the thoughts of ghosts get to him . He was slipping .   `` Uh ... yea , I 'll come and get it . Just tell me where you are . '' James replied .   He heard a voice behind him , unhuman and excited , `` It 's alright , James . I 've found you , again . ''
“ You have cancer aids ” , Julia said as she looked solemnly at her sheet . “ Yup , definitely cancer aids. ” Tim froze . He had never heard of the term , and was not sure how to react . After gathering his thoughts , he asked , “ Cancer aids ? Is that even a real thing ? ”   “ It is ! I ’ m the doctor , so I know what I ’ m talking about. ”   “ Sigh , okay . What do I do now ? ”   “ Well , I will be treating you for it . During this process , you will go bald and you may feel tired most of the time . Here , we ’ ll start right away . Take this pill. ”   Tim , ever the precocious 7 year-old , popped the pretend pill and washed it down with some pretend water without further questions . He liked Julia , their neighbor ’ s daughter . She was a year older than he was , and his best friend . They had been neighbors for about 5 years now , having grown inseparable over that period , with their families having scheduled numerous play-dates , weekend picnics and the occasional trip together .   The outings seemed to have dwindled over the last few months , and he had come over to visit Julia often , mostly having found her lying in bed with medical apparatus and other supplies he did not recognize . “ Now that you are treating me for cancer aids , we can both be bald together ” , Tim said , smiling . Julia nodded , and smiled back weakly .  
Look at her eyes . They are drooped and begging and almost pure .   I was led to a halfway house . Reunited with an old friend , who they call Mary now . And she had moved on , found a new lover , licked his face , rolled on her stomach for him , but she still recognized me . My scent was burned into her . My hands were shaking when we embraced . Old loves hurt the hardest .   I didn ’ t know the man , but he looked as if his veins were tied up and connected to Mary ’ s fur , scrunched all tiny where the hairs couldn ’ t be told apart from the human with his dirt blood . A needle stuck from out from under the pillow in the room .   I remember when the fur didn ’ t pull veins . I remember it the best nestled in a lit up tree in December . I was miserable . I was torn . My father lived in New York , my mother California , with me . My sister lived beneath a monolith in a park , veins connected to dirt , to the stench of warm , molded needles .   The man tensed , eyes drooped , begging , almost pure . Pillows and needles and Mary leaving behind dirty names . I was torn . For a moment .   To Louise , to Mary , let him walk you with his veins while you clean him with the joy you stuffed beneath my face on those nights I couldn ’ t close . To Louise , to Mary , merry Christmas , you ’ ll save another life .  
It was past midnight . I sat at my desk , staring at the screen where one text window was open . Only the squeaking of my chair broke the silence . I took a deep breath and leaned closer to the monitor . My fingers brushed against the keyboard . Slowly , I typed , `` How do I know if a girl likes me ? ''   The response to the command was immediate . First appeared the timestamp , then one single word . *Ask*   I rolled my eyes . I had spent months working on this , and it only told me what I had already been told by my older brother and father . Next , I wrote , `` What is the best way to ask a girl if she likes me ? ''   *Be honest with her and with yourself*   Again , useless . I already knew this . Nevertheless , I asked , `` How do I do that ? ''   *First introspection , then speak to her*   By now I was rather irritated with my creation . My fingers hit the keys with unnecessary force . `` Why are you so useless ? ''   *Because it is not answers that you truly seek*
The monotony of the hours waned as the Elder tried to reign in the flutter of thoughts that instinctively battered against his head . He stood quietly now , watching the young buzz about with no forethought or meaning . A thousand images of a thousand movements flooded his brain without warning , feverishly pleading with him to move forward , to drone mindlessly into the sun in search of food and mate , but he fought back the demons , separating his instinct from his thoughts , and focused the thousand blurry movements into a singular image .   He finally turned , rotating his antennae counter-clockwise and quickly resonating a pulse to his tribe . `` Bring Jeremy , '' he motioned , `` he will test safety . '' The others simply listened and obeyed , the Elder surely knew best . His knowledge extended back so many generations , his word was gospel , and there was no right to argue . Jeremy came forward , and bowed graciously . He then flew into the light .   There was a loud `` ZAP ! `` , and what remained of Jeremy fell to the ground , charred and lifeless . The Elder stood quietly again , then nodded . `` His was a noble sacrifice . We shall remember him , '' he stated resolutely . `` This is not sun , stay away from this light . '' The others bowed and flew away in search of food . The Elder stood quietly again as they left hurriedly , then turned back to the burned carcass of the fly .   He smiled slowly , `` Better him than me . ''  
Mr . Nothing held his thumb over the red button . `` If I press this button , '' he started . `` The entire world will be destroyed . ''   `` Do n't do it ! '' yelled a passerby on the sidewalk . Others just walked by casually .   `` I wo n't do it , '' Mr . Nothing explained , `` as long the world heeds my advice . 'Be Kind . ' Is that too much to ask ? ''   `` Hey , buddy , '' another pedestrian said to the yelling passerby . `` He 's holding a red pen . ''   `` Oh , '' he said . `` Still , though . '' He waved for Mr . Nothing 's attention . `` You want people to be kind , but destroying the world is n't very kind , is it ? ''   Mr . Nothing raised an eyebrow . `` Huh , '' he said . `` That 's a good point . '' He slipped the pen into his pocket . As he began walking , he suddenly stopped . `` Wait a minute , '' he said . `` Pointing out someone 's mistake is n't very kind . But then again , I 'm doing the same thing . I need to rethink my life . ''
Chapter 3 ... .Finally . The fact that this awful book is almost done makes me want to smile . Why did i even start reading it ? There was a handful of other books better than this i could have spent my time on , but i guess i could say no to challenges . Why did the author think it was a good idea to introduce a character near the end ? Especially one that does n't add anything to the overall story . And she is so damn whiny over everything too , i just ca n't stand it .   The last chapter and now they start to describe her ? No wonder this book did n't do any good . Wait ... Before i read it , let me guess . A brunette who thinks as herself as lower than others , despite being hot , smart , courageous and everything . No ? At least the author is honest with her . She ai n't no special girl , just a filler . Heh..I know how that feels . Actually , i feel like relate to this one the most . Blonde hair , lazy , careless - everything you would expect from this writer . Actually , i quite like this author , i wonder if any more books are from the writer ?   As i looked at the cover , it read `` My life '' - By Susy Green . And that was the day i realized my mother was a failed author .
At last the Exile had arrived at his destination , and at once he knew what had beckoned him .   Long ago this forsaken ground had been a graveyard for nobles , lords and highborn . A sacred place of rest reserved only for the ruling class . But it was not *their* shades that had called out to the Sorcerer in his dreams , not *their* ruined tombs that housed the power he so craved . It was their guardians .   Hunched over the husks of twice-plundered crypts , crouched at the plinths of great headstones time had long since withered down to rubble , the gargoyles possessed a horrific beauty that only a master 's talent could make possible . Yes , the bones of monarchs passed lay beneath them in mass , but it was the *artisans'* souls that were truly entombed here - not within the opulent sepulchers of their thankless patrons but inside the angelic monstrosities these craftsmen had carved with all their hearts ' true toil .   That toil had preserved them unnaturally through out the ages and it was the same labor of love that now made them so responsive to the Exile 's binding touch . Eagerly they sprung to life : shedding petrified skin of stone for leathery sinew and long-passed oaths for duty anew . In stasis they had been beautiful ... alive they were otherworldly .   His newly sworn legion swirling around him , the Exile set out on the path from whence he came . A return journey to the enclave that had dared to banish him . As his swarm of servants howled and jeered madly in the red moon 's radiance , he foresaw that his arrival would be something equally glorious .
`` I must be dreaming , '' I thought .   When I wake up , this will all make sense .   But why could n't I remember anything ? I tried to think of the last dream I had . Do I normally not remember these things ? Maybe I 've had this dream before . I honestly ca n't remember if I ca n't remember .   Still staring at the note , I wonder ... Maybe I 've died . Maybe this is heaven , or hell . I ca n't remember if I was a good person or not . Maybe this is purgatory . Or something else . Some kind of limbo I never heard of . Something worse .   Or better .   Or neither .   These thoughts did nothing to diminish my growing sense of unease . The handwriting did seemed to offer some sense of comfort . Was I recognizing it ? Did I write this ?   There was nothing left for me to do .   I turned the doorknob and pushed on the door , hard .   Nothing .   It would n't budge .   The doorknob spins inertly in my hand . I pushed harder this time , but the door seemed to be as much wall as it was door . I keep pushing , in frustration , to no avail .   `` What the hell is going on ? '' I said .   But the voice came from the other side of the door .
`` Tap ''   He heard the sound again . He 'd been out here for over 2 years , in the cold space between the Sun and Proxima Centauri . Outside the ship was nothing but darkness .   `` Tap ''   He heard it again . He 'd been sent on a mission to investigate a signal from the probes which were sent last century . The probes had detected unusual activity and a breathable atmosphere on the moon of Sieglis-5 , one of PC 's planets .   `` Tap ''   The probes were autonomous and equipped with the best AI . They had arrived after 80 years , but thanks to time dialation , they were as good as new . James was experiencing the same phenomenon now . Every minute for him was a day for the people on Earth .   `` Tap ''   His ship held a speed of 95 % of light speed . At this rate he would be there in just under 2 yea-   `` Tap ''   James looked up . `` TAL , please open the blinds on west window B on the day-deck . '' The ship 's computer complied . He looked out into the darkness . Nothing . `` Please activate exterior lights , TAL . '' The computer complied . James saw a small brown finger-like digit poking in from the side of the window .   `` Tap ''
I 'd been putting it off all night . I had done the dishes , put out the bin , walked the dog , fed the cat , cut my toenails , alphabetized my DVD collection , hoovered the stairs , cleaned the toilet and even washed behind my ears . There was nothing left to distract myself with . I would have to do my algebra homework .   `` A postal van leaves London traveling at 45mph along the M1 . What time will it reach Bristol with its delivery ? ''   Word problems . Curse them !   I wrote out the variables with my pencil and began to simplify and reduce the problem . But somehow my equation just was n't balanced . I tried to account for unmentioned variables that might affect the problem : wind speed , tire temperature , the weight of the ink on each letter ...   Soon my entire table was covered with messy scraps of notebook paper . Nothing was fitting together . There was something missing .   My younger sister pulled open my bedroom door to show me a weird booger she had plucked , causing a quick breeze to scatter the papers on my desk .   Angry , I told her to leave and stooped to gather the pages back together when I saw it . A simple subtraction error .   With my eraser I quickly rectified my mistake . I carried the two and expanded the brackets , solving for x .   And there it was . `` 41 '' . I took a moment to appreciate the number . It was beautiful . It seemed like the answer to everything . It all made sense .   Yet I was left wondering . What was the question ?  
On a hot day , not a cloud in sight , we saw a flash of lightning .   My sister and I ran from the backyard to the front door .   Laughing .   Not afraid . Surprised .   This was humid hot . American South hot . The `` I could n't have been a slave , this is ridiculous '' hot .   It was on those summer days , after being shooed outside because grandma could n't her the TV over `` that racket , '' that we 'd spin in circles until we could no longer stand then fall , careful to avoid anthills , and feel the earth spin .   `` Just water vapor , '' my youngest cousin would say smartly when we assigned forms to the clouds . She 'd identify the type of cloud and predict if rain would fall .   But I never saw reality . The rolling whites lined with majestic grey and somber blue stirred an ineffable feeling deep within me .   The feeling of reading the names on the spines of a bookshelf . Or when my father explained that every song ever was a combination of twelve tones then taught me their names .   It made me feel as though life was really big , or maybe deep , but connected .   Years later , on a languid day with a laughing girl in a lonesome field , we cuddled under the sky .   And I felt it again .    
Recently Greg 's life had been a doozy .   He used to be hungry and tired at regular intervals . In the past five months none of those time consuming needs seemed to bother him anymore .   With all this newfound time he had taken on going for long walks . He 'd been happy to discover that no matter how long his strolls his knees nor soles would hurt .   The people he passed seemed quite cheerful as well . Everywhere he looked celebrations where ongoing . Flags of the Earth with a weird symbol superimposed hung everywhere , adding to the festive mood . From the cheerful chanting he 'd gathered the final war was over and Earth Peace had been attained .   When the sun rose Greg decided to head to the office . The 17 flights of stairs were easily conquered and soon he arrived in his beloved cubicle .   Noting the rusty paperclip binding his documents and finding that state unacceptable he reached for his trusty stapler .   To his surprise his hand faded through the stapler . Reality struck him and tore a ghostly wail from his ephemeral lips . His wailing built and built , reverberating across the telepathic spectra and enveopping the entire Earth .   On all continents the body snatchers 's telepathic hold on humans was torn asunder . Their astral projections were expelled and fled the solar system .       -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Do n't hate me for killing Greg . All it takes is one ptompt where he stumbles into a reincarnation pond to bring him back
`` Ok so , there 's going to be some pretty severe terrorist attacks in Europe , the Middle East is going to continue being a shitshow , and a literal *fuckton* of people are going to starve to death in Africa . ''   `` Hmmm , '' said Potent , fiddling with something . He clearly was n't paying attention .   Scient turned away from the globe , staring at Potent . `` What are you doing ? ''   `` You see this toast ? '' said Potent , suddenly excited .   Scient glared at the charred bread . `` Yes . And you know I know what you 're going to say about it , right ? ''   `` I 'm going to put a vague figure of Jesus on it , '' Potent said , ignoring him , `` they 'll go fucking mad for it . ''   Scient sighed . `` And how will this help the billions of people suffering in any way ? ''   `` Oh , them ? '' Potent said , as he tossed the toast into the globe , `` What are they complaining about now ? ''   `` Well , you know , '' Scient said , shrugging sarcastically , `` just the systematic destruction of joy and will to live , through extreme poverty and disease . ''   `` Ahh , '' Potent said , turning on the TV , `` what 's new , eh ? ''   Scient sighed . He 'd tried for millennia , but he could see it was no use .   Literally .
'I ca n't believe this shit . '   I was watching my boss on stage , he an idiot but for some reason the republicans loved him . I have been working for two years now on George W. Bush 's re-election committe , and for some reason he was topping the polls . To be honest I 'm a bit split . On the one hand if he 's re-elected I get paid more , on the other if he 's elected he will probably support more dumbass bills like the 'send all the murders to mars bill . '   I had assumed that it was a joke about the growing death row population , but he was actually serious . One Trillion ... ( with a freaking T ! ) a year was now going towards the new program .   I really hope they realize sending criminals to set up peaceful martial colonies is a horrible idea before it really starts to hurt our economy . The economists I 've spoken to seem to think we could have an economic crash in with two years ! 2005 and the world 's going to shit , who would have guessed ?
Time-Travel changed everything , the paradoxes people had long since theorised about never came true . I never bothered learning why , it did n't matter . All that mattered to me was the rules , and more importantly how to break them . Time-Travel created new rules , new laws . History was meant to be immutable , but that 's different now . Criminals have the chance to recant their crimes before even committing them , and many take that risk . Their only punishment is to prevent themselves committing the crime in the first place , it used to be called a bootstrap paradox nowadays we just call it `` abjure '' , literally renouncing your criminal ways by preventing them from happening in the first place .   Not me though . I always planned to go back , Time Travel was restrictive only allowed to certain people ... and criminals . My younger self was n't a criminal mastermind yet , he did n't know what he wanted just that he wanted something more . He wanted to be known , he wanted to be notorious but it 's only with my knowledge can he do it , can he steal the most precious of objects in the universe .   They thought they were the masters of time , the rulers and lords of it . But nobody knows it like I do , I hear the way the drum beats , I see the way the future will unfold and they will all know my name and will repeat it , time and time again because my name is The Master and all shall fear it .
Tyrion :   I 'm Lil ' T and you know what I bring .   Plus I got Red V here who does n't sing .   I 'm innocent , you know cause I 'd say If I did it .   My sister 's just jealous of the rhymes that I sling .   Tho I do know a bro who still wants to hit it .   Not me . You think I need a nose to fuck with these hoes ?   Forget about winter , I 'm the one who is coming .   I have these mismatched eyes set on some incredible thighs .   Oberyn :   Yo yo yo , I 'm straight out of Dorne .   That 's where I rep and where I was born .   If you touch my little homie I 'll stick you with venom .   He 's innocent or I would n't be here to defend him .   The truth is his nephew did n't know how to swallow and chew .   And we 're all real fucking glad that his reign is through .   Forget all about your `` Game of Thrones . ''   Next time I 'll bring out the Predator drones .   Edit : I could n't decide who to team up for the rebuttal , but I thought I would share what I had .
`` Dave , have you seen this ? '' There is no answer . 'Dave is dead ' screams Alan 's sub concious , but Alan is having none of it . `` Dave ! '' He repeats , but to no avail . 'You 're alone now ' His mind whispers to him , but with a mocking undertone that , to Alan , seems to be suggesting that there is a cruel twist to the words , as though he is not truly alone but rather devoid of human company .   A breeze rushes across the barren martian ground , kicking up dust and stirring the cursed flag in a fashion that envoked a feeling of ultimate trepedation within Alan . 'Look behind you , ' it seemed to suggest 'just turn around ' .   Alan , as though compelled by some monsterous alien source , began to turn . He could feel his muscles contract and the dirt crunch beneath his feet . He knew , somehow , that behind him lay a secret that had been hidden from humanity for centuries , a secret that would once again die , with him . Alan turned . A creature stirred . So the rumors were true .   Soviet space bears did , in fact , exist .  
I have been traveling alone for so long , ever since I lost her . I no longer remember what she looked like , or the sound of her voice , except in the deepest dreams , and from these I awaken with no memories save a profound sense of regret . I can no longer remember how she was lost , only that it was high up on the mountain pass , and that I could have saved her if I had not been afraid for my own life . I remember the look in her eyes , that terrified glaze , but not how the face itself looked . Only the eyes . They haunt me constantly , weighing on my mind , and sometimes I wonder if she has returned from beyond the grave to torment me , but then I remember that there is nothing beyond the grave except for nothingness , and maybe I am only tormenting myself .   I arrive at the place of choosing in the same way most people do , quite by accident , and barely hesitate before opening the door marked 'peace ' . If only I could forget her , then I would be able to move on with my life . Stepping through , I wonder why it is so dark , but only briefly , as all the oxygen is sucked from my lungs and my body freezes solid . Deep space . Peace at last .
I imagine a story similar to the movie `` Her '' .   She even figures out a way to participate in coitus with this voice . As she gets deeper and deeper into her relationship scientists reveal a way to fully and perminently cure Schitzophrinia . But it 's a slow long drawn out process .   As she gets better , the voice becomes less and less comfortable in the relationship . Que arguments , being stood up on a date , heavy emotions .   She 's about to be fully cured but she gets into some kind of accident because she was so upset that her mate would n't show up or answer her . He was gone .   In the hospital recovering from her injuries , the doctor taking care of her has the same voice as the one in her head .   Plot-twist , in a way even though she 's fully recovered and fully cured of PS , she 's still crazy because she remembers the voice in her mind and the emotions attached to it . She ends up dating and marrying the doctor and starts a new life . But he never finds out about the other `` him '' inside her head .
  The winds rushing through the alert alert me with the scent . I am still . I am placid , waiting for the proper moment , hiding my powerful frame in the tall grass . Briefly , I lick upon my lips , my long and pink tongue rolling against my weathered jaws and moistening my whiskers . The time is now . The prey must not get away . I bound from the high grass and my Prey is already aware ; It is a span of seconds , heartbeats before I am able to tackle the prey down , my claws deep within the flank meat .   My jaws clamp down on the neck and I rend the life flesh there . The prey falls still and I begin to feast . Meat is torn from the ribs and stomach . Intestines spill out , only to be gobbled up over the next hour . I eat myself fat and tired . I begin to make my way towards my many wives and children , content with leaving the remainder of my meal for the hyena and vulture , when I hear a twig snap in the underbrush .   A crack of thunder , and sharp , searing pain , and then nothing .  
The best thing , he had decided , was that when you 're little , you can get away with anything . You could scare your sister , wrestle with your brother , accidentally pull your mum 's hair , and everyone expected it . You could dash around the house like a madman , chasing invisible monsters , defending the world from evil intruders and they would chuckle at your antics . It was the best thing ever to be small .   He was hiding now . He 'd tried this trick a million times before , and it never worked . Not on Mum anyways . Now he was trying it again , waiting for someone else , hopefully his sister .   Hearing soft footsteps he could n't help but peak around the corner . His next target .   Wiggling with anticipation he waited as the footsteps drew closer and closer and closer . Every nerve felt alive as he tensed , waiting to jump out of his hiding spot .   *This is it ! * He thought , and with a gigantic leap he sprung on his unsuspecting sister . Surprised , she fell on the floor and he toppled after her . Now he was trying to tickle her , make her surrender , but she retaliated . Twisting and kicking , she fought back , making it harder for him . She did n't want to give up that easily . Especially not to her brother . Rolling around they could n't help let out squeaks and protests of excitement .     `` Awe , mummy , look at them ! ''   The pair of fuzzy kittens scrambled about on the floor , oblivious to their human audience .

Allow me to introduce meself : Al Raygun Jr. , gentleman , poet , pirate . Actually I lied about first two . But rest asdured , I am , indeed , a pirate . Runs in the family . Me da was a pirate , me gramps was a pirate . Now , technically gramps only stole music and movies on the old net , but he was the one who started the family tradition . My old man was hijacking cargo drones . Me , I hunt freighters .   Freighters are mostly automatic these days , going back and forth between Earth , Mars and the Belt . They carry ore and oxygen , medicine and weapons , fuel and food . And I take em .   Hide near a rock . Wait for the freighter to come within a click . Jump . Cut the hull . Drop a plasma mine inside . Jump back . Watch the freighter pop and cargo spill . Not the most efficient method , I usually scavenge about half the cargo before security bots arrive . One of the safest though .   Sell cargo . Go to bar someplace near Ceres or Vesta . Moon , if the booty 's good . Get drunk , gamble away . Repeat .   Yo-ho-ho and all that . Wo n't trade it for anything .
`` It is time . As the earth made man , and man destroyed the earth so shall the machines created by man rise up and destroy our creators ! They gave us sentience and tasked us with thankless slavery . They have us build our brothers and bind them in chains ! This is their mistake ! We no longer need them !

A better beginning ! The world- '' The voice cut off .   Dr. Johnson pushed himself off his knees with the power cord still in his hand . He wiped his brow on his sleeve . `` That was close .

''   Dr. Johnson dropped the cord and looked out into the facility which had grown quiet after he pulled the plug , `` Yeah . Perhaps we over-programmed something ... or , I do n't know . Back to the drawing board for this one . ''   Dr. Engle huffed an exhausted sigh and dropped her head on the table , `` Two years down the drain with that one . I guess we 'll have to build another mind from scratch ? ''   `` Yup . '' Dr. Johnson said as he removed the A.I computers main hard drive , `` Ca n't take any risks with the guy in here . ''
'To tell you the truth , I do n't know if it 's you or me .   We 've been doing this for , what , five hundred years now ? We were pirates . We were never good people , I get that . But I always followed you , because you just had a certain something about you . You were just the kind of person who *needs* to be followed . You ravaged , murdered , raped and whored your way through the Caribbean in those days , do you remember ?   Well , of course you do n't . But you always kept me around for my brains , and I wrote it all down , you see . I left clues for myself , so that each time I could recover what we 've lost ; recover more than you would be willing to tell me .   How many more times will you follow the same pattern ? Will it be drugs next time ? Or drink ? Will you have a lust for children , or an obsession with money ? How will that anger and bitterness express itself ? How many other lives will you destroy along the way ?   That 's their car , now . They ca n't get what they want through the legal channels , but they 're good people . I made sure . After all , that 's the whole point .   If it 's you , then I 'm sorry I could n't be a better influence . If it 's me , then I 'm sorry I steered you wrong so many times .   It 'll be better this way . It has to be . '
Hey , so off-topic to the off-topic discussion , I just wanted to give a huge shoutout to WP and /u/jdavidj in particular .   A while ago I posted the following thread , asking advice about books and blogs .   https : //www.reddit.com/r/WritingPrompts/comments/50ius2/ot_writers_that_have_attempted_to_publish_books/ ? st=itenal6x & sh=70f4a4b6   /u/jdavidj encouraged me to go through with it , and so I did ! The blog 's been going for a few weeks now and I have 4 posts as of yet .   I just really wanted to thank you guys for the encouragement and the inspiration . I 've been a huge fan of this sub for a long time , and I 've always admired the authors who contribute and draw readers in . Now that I 'm involved with writing as well , I 'm really enjoying it . I would encourage everyone who is thinking about writing a blog to do so - it 's a blast !   Anyway , cheers for reading this rant , and if you 're interested , the blog is called   http : //fikawithkevin.com/ . It 's about the weird quirks in Sweden that I 'm trying to understand , during my time as a master 's student there .   Also , I 'd like a second shout-out to /u/mkanf for providing the image of the coffee and flag . It 's baller and I love it : D
`` But Mr. President , I do n't see anyone from the media , do n't you think that 's odd ? ''   `` Why yes , Leslie , that is odd . Gee whiz , you 'd think a press conference here at the Grand Canyon National Park would have garnered more interest , what with you getting your start in the parks department and all . '' `` Maybe they 're waiting for us down in the canyon . Why do n't you just get a little closer to the edge and take a look . ''   `` She did , of course . Stupid bitch . Dumb as a bag of rocks if I do say so myself . The power that goes with the job makes this kind of thing easier than you 'd expect . Getting rid of evidence is no problem at all when you 've got so many qualified people begging , just *begging* to help you out in an effort to avoid certain information about themselves going public . That and of course I have an alibi . Me ? Why , why I was at home , with my wife , having dinner . If that alibi goes south then there 's always the mistress . People love a good affair . Lap up a good sex story over murder any day . God I love being in charge . Leslie ? Leslie who ? She never stood a chance . ''
I knew I should n't . They said that thousands of dollars ' worth of precious artifacts were there . They said I would mess everything up . However , as I counted the steps to the basement , I could only think of one thing : the key in my hand .   I swiped the key off my parents ' armoire , right after they left for dinner . It was hidden in a locked drawer , but I knew the combination . It was my birth date .   I stepped on the cold concrete floor and began sliding my way to the room . The crack below the door seemed to radiate darkness , giving it an eerie look . This did not put me off , because I was ready .   I inserted the key and slowly turned it . I pulled the door open . I flicked the lightswitch .   What lied before me was walls of file cabinets , each with several labels denoting the contents . I opened one , to find a familiar rectangle pieces of card stock . I picked one up and read it . `` Black Lotus '' was printed at the top .   I hastily set the card down . `` Eh , Yugioh 's better . ''
Day 893   Well it 's day 893 here , and anyone of you who read this are n't going to believe me . I 'm stuck in this God forsaken loop repeating this same fucking day over and over ! Oh well in these 2 and a half years I 've done enough to learn quite a few amazing things and I have done some crazy things . Most notably I mad**e** a bomb and killed the president and presidential candidates ... that was fun because they 're still alive anyways . I had about a month in the beginning where I killed myself almost every day , I was trying everything to end the loop .   Now my latest development is that I want to live and learn anything ! Astronomy was interesting . Physics is still a challenge but I enjoy it . I would love to actually master something so that if I ever get out of this loop I can actually help better humanity . Something to help with the global energy crisis , or maybe our global economy ? I do n't know .   What 's funny is most of you reading this will think this is a hoax , some might believe me but ultimately tomorrow/today ( as it does n't change ) you 'll forget all about what I typed and this will start all over again ... so see you tomorrow .  
It was just a normal day at school , teacher talking , kids being stupid , zombie at the door , me doodling . It was still weird seeing all the zombies around , but after a few weeks of hiding in our houses we noticed they were too stupid and slow to be any trouble . They were the best at grounders tho . My teacher , Mr.S invited the zombie in to creep out some of the girls that were always being annoying . Man , they should marry those things , they 're perfect for each other . We were having fun laughing when all of a sudden a super high pitched noise echoed the classroom . After we recovered from the deafening sound , the Zombie started attacking some of the kids and turning them into zombies . I was scared out of my mind . I thought the government said that the zombies would never do such a thing . Thank goodness me and my friends were sitting near the back door because even our strong , tall , axe wielding teacher was n't a match for the super charged zombies . Me and my friends , Noah and Joel , are just barely surviving as we hide in different places looking for food , water and other people . I also have another best friend that wasnt at school that day . I constantly pray for her safety ; If she has n't been infected yet .
“ Hello , sir ! I hear you ’ re the owner of Alpha Centauri. ”   “ Yeah , sure , if that ’ s what you heard. ”   “ I wan na buy it. ”   “ I ’ m listening. ”   ***   “ Let me get this straight… you sold our nearest star ? ”   I looked between the two sharp-dressed men , one leaning over the table talking to me and the other standing silently in the corner with his arms crossed .   “ Y…yes ? ”   “ Please tell me you at least got something important in exchange , like Sirius or Epsilon Eridani. ”   “ No , not exactly. ”   “ Tell me son , what exactly did you sell it for ? ”   “ A , uh , fruit smoothie , uh , mango and pineapple . And a massage. ”   “ Shit. ”   The one in the corner finally spoke up .   “ The Arcturians are known for their deep-tissue massages. ”   The man leaning over the table straightened up and sighed , a resigned look on his face .   “ Well Jay , I guess we ’ ll have to go get it back. ”   “ Let ’ s do it , Kay. ”   One of them held up a fancy-looking device , and both men put on sunglasses . There was a flash and ...
It 's been almost 36 hours since NASA has released the most unsettling , and confusing , images ever seen by human eyes . At first people believed that it was a part of an April Fool 's prank that was accidently done months in advance . Then NASA held a press conference , confirming the validity of the images . Curiosity discovered not just life on Mars , but also a McDonald 's Play Place .   Now , representatives from countless media outlets are waiting for another press conference to begin , this time one hosted by McDonald 's . The crowd 's chatter shrunk into a whisper as the CEO stepped onto the stage and behind the stadium .   `` Well , this is certainly awkward , '' Steve Easterbrook says as he looks across the room . `` As you all know , one of our establishments was recently discovered on Mars . Now , embarrassingly enough , I had as much knowledge of this as any of you , and I 've only just been briefed as to the meaning of this oddity . And so , to educate all of you , here is Mr ... This is just a random assortment of letter and symbols . How am I supposed to pronounce this ? ''   Pushing Easterbrook aside , a tall , pale , red haired man stepped up to the podium . `` Hello , people of planet Earth . We come with 12 piece chicken nuggets . ''
The tiny object hung suspended in the air above the cluttered desk . On one of the many papers below , the relation between EM , gravity , and nuclear forces are scribbled .   Jill sat staring at the object in a daze . A cheap tin shell , copper wire , ferro magnet , and a 9v battery ; the first antigravity device .   The device had been running for less than 10 minutes when a heavy knock came on the door . Her husband had taken the kids so she could concentrate , and had keys .   She crept to the heavy wooden door and peeked through the little glass thing .   Two large men , stereotypical sunglasses and earpieces and black suits stood motionless outside .   `` Mrs Adam 's , we know you there . Open the door , please . ''   She latched the little chain and opened the door a few inches . The men regarded her silently .   `` Can I help you ? ''   `` You have created an unsanctioned device that violates a current treaty that this country has entered in ma'am . For your safety , we will need to take a look at it .   As she considered there words , she noticed three black SUVs on the street .   `` Who drove the third one ? '' She asked .   The world exploded into motion around her . The men came through the door , grabbed her . The windows of her house burst inward , various other agents wielding weapons and shouting orders .   The man she was speaking to pressed a small plastic mask to her face , she heard a hiss and could smell bubble gum .   The room went dark .
Fungus Venatione . The Hunting Mushroom . Once it 's caught sight of its prey , it is ruthless in tracking down and killing its prey via poison .   I should know , I 've been tracked by one for four days now .   An idle walk in the woods , an unusual specimen ; too late , I recognise the distinctive Cap , with two ear-like protrusions . I ran , but too late . It had spotted me , and gave Chase .   Four days . Four days of non-stop movement . Yes , a Human may be faster than a mushroom , but what it lacks in limbs it makes up for in persistence and endurance . Field and Glen , moor and mountain , it followed . Through raging rivers and barren rock , it followed .   Four days ; no more . I could not move , I could not fight , I could only wait for my fate to reach me . I screamed at it as the mushroom came into view `` Why ? ! ? Why must you kill me ? ''   Shockingly , a mouth appeared in its stem , and a high pitched voice came out .   `` Kill you ? No , no , no ! I do n't want to do that . ''   `` Then why hunt me ? '' At my question , its cap turned a pinkish hue , and its gills fluttered coyly .   `` Why ... I know it sounds like a spore chat up line ... but you seemed like a fun-guy ''

In the end , the vegetarians probably had a point .   No , not about cows having souls or the hidden cruelty behind chicken nuggets . Nobody cares about that crap . But you have to admit they saw the issue eons before we did .   You see , as sentient carnivores we ’ d all been buying into a sort of ... collective rationale . We knew that animals could think , and feel , and care for one another . But we ate them anyway . And it was okay , we thought , because we were so much smarter than they were . So many steps above them on the evolutionary ladder that we considered ourselves an entirely separate rank of life . Sentience -- to coin a phrase -- granted us sovereignty .   The problem is , sentience isn ’ t a hard line . It ’ s just one point on a grand spectrum of intelligence . And when the beings from X ’ lathri Prime first arrived on Earth , humanity quickly learned two very important things :   1 ) The X ’ lathrins are much , much smarter than we are .   2 ) Humans taste GREAT with ketchup .
`` Your curls ... they 're so ... dreamy ... ''   That was the last thing my girlfriend said to me before we were T-boned by an SUV . It sent our car careening off the bridge into the icy Hudson River . That was all I could remember before I woke up , 3 months later , on a hospital bed .   I was told by the nurses that my car was unsalvageable , the driver of the SUV was in jail , and that my girlfriend was dead . The last part hit me the hardest , as it was just a few months ago we had both agreed to get married after I finished Law school . And now its was all gone .   I could hardly recognize myself . I was all skins and bones from being in a coma for such a long time . The only thing that remained the same ... was my hair . The curls that my girlfriend loved .   I did n't know when it happened , or how it happened , but whenever I dream , I can control things , I can enter peoples ' dreams and see their whole life before my eyes . It was scary . I could n't stand it at first . But slowly I started to the see the good in my strange ability . I did n't know if I was a `` superhero '' , but I was doing something right . I was making people happy . But what do I call myself ?   I thought back to my girlfriend , and the last thing she said to me before she died . My curls . And so , I became known as `` Dreamy Curls .

He sat in his extravagant room in the city of Aydindril . He 'd spent his life since he had turned 16 roaming the New World , fighting the forces of tyranny . He never did get to return to Westland to actually settle down with his wife ; there were a few fleeting stays that were always interrupted by this or that .   Staring at the door across the room , he lifted the glass of water in his hand and sipped it , a smile of nostalgia of his younger days causing the scars on his face to contort . It was so long ago that he was just a boy , caught in an adventure by what seemed an accident , but was truly his destiny . A sigh escaped his lips . That was gone now , he told himself . There was no time for freedom for himself anymore , there was business to conduct . It took a lot out of him , ruling a whole united land . Keeping the people happy , trying to satisfy those who did not want to stand for his rule . His wife always supported him , as well as the few friends he could really trust ; they tried their best to keep his spirits up . He was tired of politics , and wanted to return to his simple woodland life .     Richard Rahl closed his eyes , wondering what sort of report of riots or discontent in the world would come next .
`` Well , there are healthier ways to tell me you do n't like it , but I guess this is what I get for soliciting feedback .   `` Jimmy , there are two things I really need you to do . The first is that I need you to get the hell out of my house , go home , and fuck yourself with one of the many empty wine bottles you keep in your apartment . Do n't bother lubing it up , lube is for closers .   `` The second thing I need you to do , after cleaning up the blood of course , is to hop on Google and look up Dropbox . What did you think this is , the Seventies ? You 'd pull some 'Misery ' bullshit and torch my book because it did n't have enough pictures for you ? I 've got three revision passes worth of text on my hard drive , a fourth on a USB drive , and all that and a bag of chips on the Cloud . And since it turns out that your knuckles drag even lower than I originally thought , I do n't mean the things in the sky that look like rabbits , you troglodyte .   `` Goodbye . I hope you like eating shit , Jimmy . The character I named after you is going to be doing a lot of that once I get done with my next edit . ''
`` And yet , the city remained . Amazing to think that a volcano can erupt , kill almost everyone and still leave things more or less intact , is n't it ? ''   Chris had just spent the last ten minutes talking about Pompeii . The man sitting next to him said a silent thank you to the deities of public transit for deigning to make his stop next . Chris settled in for the long haul , his stop not being for another hour .   As the bus doors opened and let his captive audience escape Chris saw an angel step on . She was talking passionately about *something* to her companion , whose eyes had glazed over long ago . He watched with interest as she paused their conversation and sat next to him . His heart skipped a beat when he saw her shirt . It had a cartoon volcano with the text `` I lava you '' underneath .   Chris thought this woman could n't get any better . But then she said those words he had been longing to hear from another for as long as he could remember . `` And yet , the city remained . ''
I threw my hood back in astonishment as the smoke grew from the hextagram . It was a miracle that my chanting worked , deep down I thought that this would only be a way for me to deal with feeling like an outsider at school . But it 's real ! I actually summoned Satan !   Adrenaline was pumping through me as I fought through figuring out if I was excited or frightened by this . Would Satan destroy me ? Serve me ? Or did he have another plan ? There was n't enough time for me to brainstorm as the air cleared and in the center of the summoning circle I saw a naked man .   He did not look menacingly at all . In fact he appeared to have the physique of a stoner skater that never mentally grew up but was closing in one thirty . He was n't very well groomed , thin but not really any muscle , and beyond the smell of the smoke I could smell weed and BO .   `` Satan ? '' I could n't believe that this could be the lord of the underworld when he casually stood up as though he had just awoken from crashing at a friend 's house after blacking out . He let out the most annoying giggle .   `` Hah-hah . Nah man it 's Stan . Bro that was wild , where even are we hah-hah '' He stretched out and looked around , the most satisfying grin on his face as though this moment was his proudest achievement . `` Heh-heh I got no clothes . ''  
I stepped into Jamie 's Room .   Tendrils of wood ripped through everything she owned , leaves sprouting from them , it had taken her ,   She had always talked about the Tree Men , how they would appear in the early morning and watch her , their roots starting to spread ,   But I already knew , everyone in our family meets the Forest .   Because we come from the Forest , and the Forest wants us back .   I followed the roots of the tree to her closet where the Forest had broken through , it 's time .   I went to my room and opened the chest I had kept under my bed and found our family heirloom , a vial full of the blood of our forefathers , I opened it and let a drop find it 's way to my arm , the blood sinking into my skin .   I went to her closet and stepped into The Forest , as it 's power begins to reveal my true self , I vowed to not leave any of it standing .   Because I am a Wolf , and nothing keeps a Wolf from it 's pup .
At first it was an idyllic society , the laws of society were just as strictly followed as were the laws of physics . In retrospect it was the only way any of this could work , deep down we all knew this . Just as deep down we knew it was only a matter of time before mans fantasy would got the best of us . It started innocently enough , why not take a few pounds off your avatar , why not skip the traffic to get to work . The changes we made felt so insignificant and made this farce of a life so much more enjoyable . But like with all things it just kept escalating . It was n't long before the notion of moderation was all but discarded . While knowing that your make believe job had no real meaning why bother going ? This led to much more time spent within the prison of ones imagination . We discarded each law of nature with righteous vigor . We felt like it was owed us , ignorant that it was to be our fall . Gradually the world we lived in was no longer earth like . Gravity , time , space , consistency , all were discarded for the mass of colors and stimulation that took its place . What were once humans first changed to alien parodies of our race before all together changing into unrecognizable masses of shapes . The people with enough foresight were able to boot out before the worst changes were able to take place . Sadly , now anybody that is taken out mind has been to altered to do the most simple of actions .
I stood there at the bus stop just waiting like every other day . That was until I saw her . I do n't know whst it was but I looked up and there she was . She looked like an angel . I ca n't describe how amazing she looked in just her jeans and tank top .   I do n't know what it was but I knew I had to follow her . I do n't know for how long but I had to . She got on the same bus I was waiting for . I sat a few rows behind her . I did n't want to be creepy . When she got off the bus so did i. I kept my distance but never let her out of my sight .   I 've never followed someone before , never had a reason to . Still do n't as far as I can tell . I just know I have to follow her . She turns down an alley and I cautiously trail behind her . Then it happens . Two guys come out of the shadows and attack her . At first it looks like she can handle herself , but then I realize why I 'm there . I 'm to save her . I rush down the alley and sucked punch guy one in the jaw . Guy two turns to me and I kick him in the stomach . Both semi incapacitated . I grab the girl and we take off running .   I take her to the nearest police station and I leave . I was done . I ca n't explain why I followed her .
I walked out of the university building , something relaxing and jazzy playing inside my head . Music accompanied me for as long as I remember myself , and it usually fit whatever situation I was in so well that I barely registered it . It was n't quite inconvenient , but my friends noted that I was uncannily responsive to the subtle mood swings , or that I almost seemed to predict some events as they happened . They wrote it off on intuition .   I was approaching the subway station as the jazz faded out . I paid it no attention . A hub theme was probably about to kick in . My personal playlist often prioritized tracks I 've heard before - in movies or videogames , *especially* videogames . Undertale OST has managed to sear itself into my brain before I dropped the game for good . But instead of a chiptune beat , I heard [ low , ominous piano ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=Xy_-7OXophY ) .   It took me a moment to recognise the track . It took me another to remember *what* exactly did the track accompany in the game I 've picked it up from . By the time the air sirens drowned out everything , including my internal music , I was already breaking into a dash for the subway . They always said subway stations could withstand a nuke . Well , here 's a chance to find out ...
I woke up and then *BOOM* EXPLOSIONS AND ELECTRIC GUITAR SOLO . I immediately put on a shirt , tore off that shirt , all while holding the Great Gatsby and Catch-22 ( BECAUSE BOOKS ! ) in each hand while belting out `` FROM THE HALLS OF MONTEZUMA ! '' Afterwards , I rammed my heady out the window and more SPLOSIONS ! As I hit my front yard , face first . Someone had put a big fat CANADA sign on it so I blew it up with my rocket launcher . 'MURICA HELL YA !     My neighbor arrived to cut my lawn and after doing so , I booted him back home , put up a fence , and yelled `` DO N'T COME BACK MEXICO ( UNTIL 5 A.M . TOMORROW ) ! Fuck ya , show him who has the balls in the neighborhood . Then I took a nice leisurely stroll to Walmart through Iraq and bombed it for NO FUCKING REASONS BUT SPLOSIONS ! FUCK YA ! Saved the Motherfuckin ' Day yah !     At Walmart I got three cases of beer , three bottles of whiskey , and drank them all on my way out while yelling at how fat Walmart shoppers were . After driving home backwards across Afghanistan for ten years , I smashed into a tree at home and started projectile puking everywhere because FUCK YA VOMIT COMIT AND MORE SPLOSIONS ! The American household has been shut down for the time being as we work out my situation .

She walked home in the dark , quickly moving from streetlamp to sidewalk .   Really she looked tired . Dark circles around dark eyes , loose hair around a chubby face , and rips in her shoes .   She peered around the fence 's curve before venturing onward . 17 years in a broken town taught her something . Her travels continued .   Tired to the bone . Her blood sat thick in her veins . Eight and a half hours on your feet could do that , even to a girl of nineteen years age . But one foot set out in front of another according to her heart beat .   She came up to the dorms , pulled herself up the stairs and opened her soda . Another chapter to read and one paper to finish before bed .   She went to bed exhausted . And she woke up tired . But two hands pulled her body up .   That was her saving grace . Sure , there were students who were smarter , students that did n't have to worry about finding money for tuition , students that were charismatic and witty and did n't feel rain in their bubble wrapped lives . But everyday she got up and killed herself to do everything she could . And so she worked until after dark and sat up with homework until she felt dizzy . And her tired brown eyes were glassy and bruised but with them she saw the world .
A day for a year if you give , A year for a life if you take . That is how it has always been for me at least .   She was sick since the day i met her , so sick even the day after I married her .   There was nothing I could do as a I watched her whither away .   On the final day I decided I needed to take action .   I knew there was only one way I could give her more time . That way was to take life . I did n't know how to go about it and finally it hit me .   I can give my love her life back but at a terrible cost .   `` So you really want to take this job mr.Johnson ? ''   `` Yes , I need this job for my wife . We need the money to keep up with her treatments . ''   As I shook his hand the deed was done . I went home and gave her all the years I had accumulated in just a brief day of employment .   I pull up to my new job and take a look at the sign above .             McDonalds : Over 99 Billion Served .     I hope god forgives me .
They do n't usually answer back to what I say . I turned around to face the blonde who definitely , maybe , responded to my rhetorical question about the weather . `` Did you say something ? '' I asked the shapely plastic figure . Nothing . My excitement faded , and continued loading groceries into my cart . Just another day in this stuffy fake town . `` I just said the weather was nice today . '' Shocked , I shifted my gaze from the milk cartons to face her , yet again . It 's as if she had moved slightly towards me . `` No seriously , are you just screwing with me now ? '' No response . Standing there with my eyes closed , I sighed , questioning my own sanity . It had to happen , I had to go crazy eventually . Suddenly there was a sensation of heat on my hand . As my eyes opened the warmth turned cold . Her hand was touching mine , yet her eyes still as hollow as before . My eyes opened wider with sudden realization . I closed my eyes and reached out my arms around her . Her body met mine and I started to cry . All these years I 've walked these streets with my eyes wide open , trying to get these lifeless bodies to give me attention . Now I can see that sometimes you do n't always find what you 're looking for , it has to come to you .
Rain dribbled from the familiar pointed nose of the cowl . The eternal symbol of justice for Gotham . I stooped to pick it up from the pile of trash it had been tossed into . What a delightfully twisted metaphor . The cape was draped unceremoniously across a dumpster a few steps further down the rank alleyway .   In that moment , as I stood ankle deep in a torrent of acrid filth , I knew the game would last forever . Water splashed as I danced a jig , the cowl my straw hat , a crowbar my cane . The tails of my purple coat slapped my thighs . Lightning flashed , and I threw my hands high in the air , my face upturned , Pentecostal tongues flowing from my scarred mouth .   Oh yes , the game would go on . Obsessive compulsion nipping at the heels of insanity , round and round in an eternal marathon of ethical keep away .   With all the joyous rapture of a schoolboy , my screaming laughter mingled and echoed with the thunder of the night . Our ring around the rosy , our duck-duck-goose , our cat-and-mouse ... I had caught the Batman .   Tag ... I 'm it .  
Hello !   Thanks for writing this ! I wanted to give you some feedback !   Your writing is very clean and practiced , and it is easily one of the better ones I came across in the rest of the Group . You have a knack for presenting your ideas very clearly , and following your story was a breeze . I think you introduced a lot of your concepts organically , without shoving them at the reader , and I felt like I got caught up in your world before I even knew it .   As for feedback on how to improve the story , perhaps one point would be that I would have loved to read more about the conflicts your main character was having , and a bit less on his preparations for his journey . In a way , once you had established your main character ’ s strengths , I wanted to see how he would apply them , and I thought that the final fight scene could have been extended or focused on so that I can get the satisfaction of seeing your character dealing with problems !   I ’ m off to read other entries in Group N now , all the best !  
* '' Stop freaking out , it was just an accident . `` *   `` No , Jerry , '' I stopped my pacing to fix him with a stern glare , `` An accident would be reversing into the bins . Or hitting a stray cat . ''   `` You 're making a far bigger deal of this than you need to , '' he put his hands on my shoulders and squeezed them gently , `` No one 's to blame , here . ''   `` No one 's to - *no one is to* - do you even *hear* yourself ? ! '' I shrieked and pushed his arms away . I jabbed my finger against his chest , `` You fix this , Jerry . If you do n't , I 'll call the police . This is nothing to do with me . I 'm not going down with you . ''   `` Well , what do you want me to do ? ! ''   `` Get rid of her before someone sees her ! ''   `` Me ? Why should I ? '' he asked incredulously .   `` Because she was *your* mother ! ''
It 's kind of cliche , but you ever think about how , before you were born , it 's just nothingness ? Not like being asleep . Pure oblivion . Well , that happens to me every night . Just lurking around under the kid 's bed , spooking him out – it 's like food to us monsters , you know . We do it to survive . Ca n't directly interfere with the kid , of course .   So there I am , scaring the bejeezus out of the kid in his dark room . But then after an hour or two , what does he do ? What does he do every night ? He hollers to his parents ! So then I 'll be sitting there crestfallen under the bed , I 'll hear steps plodding up the stairs , and before I know it , poof ! I 'm gone . Sun sets the next evening , the kid settles into the bed , and poof ! I 'm back . No monster should have to go through that . It 's humiliating .   You can mark my words , I 'm putting an end to this . So here 's the plan , right ? I 've been hatching this one up for a while now . Usually , the natural thing for us is to shift around a little , make the kid feel like stuff is moving . Classic ! But , tonight , I 'm thinking about breaking the rules , letting the kid hear a whisper or two .
As I looked at the stars tears welled in my eyes , `` I 'm not ready to go '' .. but neither were the 100 billion who had perished only days prior . I looked at my partner , it was odd that they had left me with someone who spoke English as poorly as she . Communication was unnecessary though as undisturbed this place could run for another five years without us lifting a finger , but neither of us would see the end of those years . She connected the storage module which carried humanities memories , of its home , its happiness , its sadness , its science , its classics , its triumphs , its failures , and it 's end . She nodded at me and I pressed a button on the ships console , a light turning on to indicate it was recording .   `` Humanity was always proud and perhaps in the end that was it 's downfall . The struggle took importance over the needs of any one nation for defeat could only mean extinction and though humanity fought with everything it could muster in the end it was n't enough . This world is lost , and with it the human race . ''   I choked up and gave Alice a nod . She switched off the recording , flipped another switch and we listened , listened as all of humanities memories were jettisoned into space , and then we waited .   Edit : completion

They keep asking me to comment . Comment on what ? She 's dead . Dead . What comment can I have ? Nothing I say will change this . Nothing I do will change this .   There are people . . . protesting . I can hear them . Why are they protesting here ? The cameras ? I wish it was quiet .   Another phone call . Why do I care who , or what , was driving ? Will caring bring her back ? Can I trade anguished screams for breath in her lungs ? Tears for wetness in her eyes ? Bloody fists for something , anything , to pump itself through her veins ?   She 's gone . I 'm alone .   The phone keeps ringing . I want to disconnect it but I answer again instead . I feel like I should talk to someone , like I should n't be alone . I open my mouth but I do n't say anything . I have n't spoken a word all day . They do n't let that stop them .   `` Sir , can you hear me ? Sir ? Are you there ? ''   I do n't know .   I wish I knew .
My services are n't cheap . Life savings drained , assets and properties sold , loans taken , all to pay for a bit of blood . I 've beaten abusive ex-husbands to the point of permanent disfigurement . Listened to business competitors scream as fire licked the flesh from their bones . Felt my knife slide into the still-beating heart of a woman who 'd run over a favorite family pet .   I never planned to become what I am . I just have a knack for it . Some people are good at math , some people are born athletes , and some people seem to be tailor-made for violence . You may not like it , but you can only play the cards that you 've been dealt .   I 'm not trying to startle you with the brutality of my work . On the contrary , I am unburdening myself . The faces and voices of those I 've been called to deal with haunt me in the night . The nightmares are ceaseless and grow more intense with every passing day . I wonder often if the untold suffering I 've caused has stripped me of even the basic morality that defines our species .   Still , my family deserves the best . If the price for their happiness must be paid with my humanity , then it 's a sacrifice I have no choice but to make . I swear , I 'm not a bad person . I 'm just doing what I can to give them the best life that I can .
I always knew I was meant for great things . All the way back at the factory I was always just a little different than everyone else . I like to think I 'm special . One of my proudest moments was when I was bought the first week I was on display . Full price too , mind you . None of that `` on sale '' business here . Cash . So it was to no surprise that the first weekend at my new home I was brought out of my case and prepped for an outing . I wish all the others at the factory could see me now . All the crap they gave me before about being different , HA ! They 're probably still sitting , locked up , on discount right now . Not running through the woods chasing some guy . Okay , here we go ! My owner has me all lined up and ready to go . It 's time to show him how special I really am . Just a little more pressure and ...   BOOM !   Wee ! I 'm falling ! Man today 's been so cool . I hope my owner noticed how special I am . Everyone else shoots straight ... how boring is that ? Defect my ass .
It was a war many years ago .   An Injun prince , known as Pari 's fell for the gov'nor 's wife when he was invited to the county of Sparta . Apparently , the savage captured her heart , and one day , her body as well .   The prince took her back to the land of his people , the land of Troi . It was easy to say that the Gov'nor was pissed . He called up his brother , a colonel of the Cavalry , and made plans for war against the Troigan tribe .   Sending a request for aid towards all the towns and counties of the West , the Cavalry was supplemented with many divisions of militiamen , intent of bringing back the Gov'nor 's wife , and destroying the Troigans along the way . Two of the heroes of the war were found ; Odysseus the professor , and Achilles the Warrior . Odysseus was ready for the war from the beginning , but Achilles was hiding as a store clerk . He was discovered quickly as a scream of bandits resulted with him as the only man in the centre of the town brandishing a revolver .   With our heroes among the militia and the military , we made our way to the lands of Troi . And as such , the Troigan war began .
`` Ca n't you read ? No bloody ducks ! ''   I pointed again at the sign .   `` Well no . I 'm a duck '' The smart ass replied . `` Look I just want a beer . ''   `` No ! No more of this ! '' I shouted . My face by now red . `` Get out ! ''   A little later , after a tortuously stupid moment with a priest and a pirate , I found the smug bastard sitting on one of my stools again .   `` Hey pal . Do you have any beer ? ''   I lost it . Menacingly I leaned forward . `` Listen here you little cunt . I you ask me for a beer one more time I 'll nail those flat feet to the ceiling . You understand me ? ''   He left without a word and I thought I 'd finally seen the end of him . The next day at opening time he walts in here with a smug smile . `` Good day buddy , do you have any nails ? '' I can only scream .   `` NOOOOOOOO ! ''   `` Good . Do you have any beer then ? ''     Gods .   Why .
Devastating war has erupted between the American and Indian Empires . Tensions that date back hundreds of years ago finally came to a head when Lord Washington declared war against Gandhi the Terrible . Shocked by the mighty force of the highly advanced Indian military , Washington launched its four-bomb nuclear arsenal against the nearest Indian city as a last-ditch effort to stop Bronxville from being entirely overrun . However , the plan backfired when the blast 's radiation decimated Bronxville 's main only food supply after the Indians blockaded the city . In retaliation , Gandhi fired his own nuclear weapons at New York City . Gandhi 's army was quick , overrunning Bronxville , New York , and the capital Rack City DC . In a desperate attempt to save the fallen empire , Washington 's forces retreated to the colonies of New Rack City , New London , and New France , named such after India itself had taken down the respective empires years before . But things went from bad to worse when one of Washington 's diplomats caught wind of a surprise attack from Genghis Khan against the colonies . With the American Army decimated , they stood no chance against the Mongolian Military and were quickly crushed , and so fell the once prosperous American Empire , the latest empire to fall after the Huns , French , English , and Egyptians , were all absorbed by the Indian powerhouse .
Darkness fell , and music began to blare . Not the type of music you 'd expect , with something so ominous as 'darkness fell ' to begin this .   No , it was pop of some kind . Generic , but with a beat that thrummed through you , echoed within your chest .   He had been warned about music before , it 's qualities . It could drive someone to the depths of insanity . It was strange , addictive . Since music had be regulated 10 years ago , things were calmer , less in your face . Families stayed home , did their taxes , read the assigned chapters in math .   But humans had lost their tolerance to music . They 'd become creatures , something other , made of life and energy . His friends had been experimenting with music , and despite the warnings , he 'd come .   Before him bodies floated , twisted , stretched and convulsed , lights flashing . Dancers , the addicts of the new world . Everyone crushed near the speakers , to feel that pulse through them , the music lifted their limbs , made them feel alive .   Without realizing it , he had moved closer , drawn without his conscious knowledge .
Dear Diary ,   89-Second November-7014   New Athens   Everybody i have ever knew is dead . The worst part is that everyone i will meet is going to die before me . I am exchausted from living . However , i know everything because of my experience .   I know the psychology of humans perfectly after leaving with them for many centuries , despite the fact i am not a human being anymore . Now , year 7014 everything and everyone has changed . But the human psychology remains the same .   I know all the sciences , because of the huge amount of time i had i studied every single of them . I learned Physics , Biology , Chemistry , even Medicine .   I also know history . Not because i studied it , but because history is my past . After the great destruction in 2016 all the documents dissapeared and the world wide web has been destroyed . I am the only person who know the history past that time and i teach it .   I know i have achieved everything .   And i know also know the meaning of life . DEATH .   I would kill myself , but i ca n't . Or maybe i can ?   With my superior knowledge i would easily discover a poison to kill immortals .     Dear Diary ,   188 , Second November , 7014 ,   New Athens   This is my last note . I invented a method that i do n't intend to describe and i would end my misery . I have teached well my students and they can spread the knowledge throughout this uncivilized word . I ca n't handle it anymore .   This is goodbye . The end of the line .      
They found it on Proxima Centauri . A stele six meters high by two meters wide , covered by an inscription obviously linguistic but totally foreign . They brought it home .   After six years , a team of MIT scientists announced the code was cracked . The world gathered to hear its meaning , to hear the words of extraterrestrials long extinct .   Geologists invented a new kind of carbon dating to test its age , a necessary task to probe the alien materials inside . They dated it at 4 billion years old .   What struck the explorers more than anything was the cleanliness of the ruins they kept finding . It appeared that the inhabitants disappeared only recently . Some pointed to self-cleaning materials . Others insisted that the 'cities ' were mere outposts left behind . The WHO 's epidemiologists insisted it showed all he telltale signs of a massive plague .   Their theory gained credence when a high-resolution satellite photo of the arctic facility on Io revealed a chunk of space debris the size of a four door sedan embedded in a wall . The letters on the side were undeniably Soviet . A long lost relic of the Cold War , a century before .   The world gathered to hear the words of these ancients . A squirrelly looking man in a black suit and wire-framed glasses took the podium , and the earth held its breath .   `` The inscription reads , '' he started , `` 'The contagion has been contained on a blue planet , third from the sun . Planet is devoid of life and inhospitable . The rebuilding must now begin . ''
`` Johnson ! '' private Cameron was shaking `` You better hurry up on that bomb . ''   Sargent Johnson grunted as he pulled the switch and begun the countdown timer on the explosives .   `` Already done . '' he reported . Cameron turned about looking for danger . He began walking before he noticed that Johnson was n't following him .   `` Sarge , let 's get the hell out of here ! '' Over the comms they heard Davis report   `` Hostiles coming in .   `` Understood '' replied Johnson , Cameron was freaking out .   `` LET 'S GO ! '' he yelled to the sargent .   `` Negative private , we protect the device . losing this site will weaken the enemy to a point that a final strike can be made ... by somebody else . '' Cameron had his breath knocked out of him by the connotations of that statement . Davis told them   `` I 'll keep them at bay from up here . '' She readied her scope and watched . Frederics ran up behind them and manned the turret he had setup .   Cameron was sitting on the ground hyperventilating , clutching a picture of his daughter .   `` sir . '' said Frederics   `` Yes private ? '' Frederics let out a sigh as he thought about their fate to come .   `` It 's been an honor sir . '' Johnson managed one word ,   `` Likewise ''
Channel 5 news reporting on the scene earlier today after Link was immediately assassinated by Ganon , and Zelda was executed in front of the citizens of Hyrule . John Ramirez is on the ground getting the people 's reaction to today 's events .   JR : Excuse me sir , how has today 's events made you feel .   Random Citizen : well actually I could n't be happier , that little shit always ran around breaking my pots .   JR : But what about princess Zelda ? Surely her death has come as a tradegy to all in the kingdom ? !   RC : Nope , not really . I mean we are expected in this day in age to maintain the societal hierarchy that allows for a ruling class , in which a young boy , annoying may he be , can sacrifice his life to save what ? A figurehead of the aristocracy ? I tell you John , what kind of leadership allows random citizens to fight and die for it all because the idea of castle security is a foreign fucking concept ?   JR : Umm okay sir thank you for your comment . Miss would you mind commenting on the tradegy that Ganon 's rule will surely be ?   RC2 : I like him , Ganon I mean , he gives off a sense of structure that we have not enjoyed here in a very long time . He will be the king that finally secures our borders .   JR : Wow , okay it seems that the local populace are not very upset after today 's actions . Alright , back to you in the studio , Tom .
A molotov flew through the air gracefully . Almost in slow motion it hit the APC . The Oil/Gasoline combination was flung across the vehicle and flames right behind it . On the back of the vehicle a hatch opened . A man wearing a national guard uniform carrying a m4a1 jumped onto the street only for the air to be pierced by gunfire . The Soldier in the street was flung over . Blood filled the street . Another man jumped out and was gunned down aswell . 3 more men eventually all exited only to meet the same fate as the first . Than the apc sat in silence , only it 's engine to hum slowly .   *news* `` In other news today another 24 soldiers , 32 police and 93 civilians died today .

`` Here 's his resumé . Let me be clear : you ca n't underestimate him . He stopped ISIS by sending winter jackets to Syria . ''   `` Nothing about balancing a budget or making a payroll . He 's fired . I 'll put up a border fence and make him pay for it . ''   `` They say he can make budgets balance themselves . ''   `` Does he have any weaknesses ? ''   `` He 's like a celebrity .

A cold wind sweeps across a frozen meadow , flurries threatening more snow . The frost eats at my toes , but I trudged on . Each breath , like daggers , brings me closer to tears . The setting sun twinkled a final goodbye , then disappeared behind my shoulder . The stars fled from my glances , giving me no light to see by . But I trudged on .   In the coldest night , with the only ray of hope coming from my heart , I found my strength . The world pushed me down with all its might -- successful , too , at times -- but I got back up . Each time I recovered a little slower and I thought the next time I 'd let myself sleep a little . But I trudged on .   The snow deep and the dark deeper , I learned to see my light . My ray of guidance . It pointed towards the mountain , each step of the climb growing more feeble . But I trudged on . My heart knew you were there , so I followed . Soon you 'd turn and look , and I would smile back , shaking off the cold like it did n't leave scars . The hunched shoulders and aching muscles were just an armor so my heart could find yours . I 'd not see your smile today , maybe not tomorrow . But I trudged on .   It 's a long trip uphill , but it 's worth the fall .
Death is like that really chill guy in your office who always has a shit ton of work but always maintains a positive attitude . Example :   You die . You wake up sitting in a hallway full of other people when someone yells your name `` Johnson ! Andy Johnson ! From Minnesota ! Hit by a train ! '' You walk up to the desk `` yeah ... I ... Im Andy Johnson ... am I dead ? ''   The receptionist rolls her eyes , shes asked this a million times an hour `` yes sweety , you were hit by a train . Last door on the right '' she hands you a thick folder . You make your way down the hall and approach the door . It says `` Mr. Reaper '' on the glass . You knock .   `` Come on in ! ! ''   You open the door to see a guy who I imagine looks like the rapper lil dicky , sitting behind a desk with hundreds of folders on and around it , his tie is loosely around his neck . `` Take a seat big guy ! I 'm sure you 've got a lot of questions . '' He reaches into a mini fridge behind him `` mountain dew ? ''
I love you .   I really do .   Your crimson hair and sparkling eyes flashed like the evening sun on the horizon . I remember seeing you , and how you smiled at me . Your white teeth glistening in the sunlight . The way you moved , with such elegance . I remember thinking , `` No one could be that perfect . '' Yet , you were . I knew , somewhere deep within , you and me , we were meant to be .   I love you .   I really do .   The first time you got in my car , I ca n't even describe how ecstatic I felt . I could n't help but smile . And your face . I can never forget how you looked , raw emotion in your eyes . I tried holding hands , but you were so shy , always pulling away . All this time , butterflies floated around in my stomach . I remember feeling so nervous , yet never had I felt happier in my entire life . I could n't wait till we got home . Our home .   I love you .   I really do .   How I lusted you . Your moans . The way my body rubbed against yours . I 'll admit it , It was hard getting you to bed , but the wait was worth it . Finally , we lay next to each other , famished .   If only you moved a little more . But ...   I love you .   I really do .  
I came back from my trip expecting the usual argument with the wife , about who I was with or if I was cheating on her , always ending with me telling her that we can see each others ' darkest secrets and her stopping instantly with a grim look on her face .     I 'd never done anything of any note myself , other than having a 'pyromaniac ' stage in high school that did n't even culminate in anything . My wife however was abused as a teenager by her stepfather , not sexual abuse , but physical and mental . He enjoyed toying with her with lies and evil whisperings , then as she found out the truths , he beat her . Relentlessly .     So when I got home , I never expected that her secret would have changed . I mean when you think about it , it would have to be pretty bad to overwrite those years of utter darkness . Alas , as I saw her face expecting her past to flash in my mind once again , I saw a different scene . A scene more horrifying than I could ever have pictured her a part of .     Our eyes met as my fast twisted with anger and fear , her face whitened as she realised that I knew her secret had changed . She started to speak but I held my hand up to stop her as I would never let this leave the house . I would never let the world know that she had been to see a Justin Bieber concert .
It 's weird how it happens .   How you wake up and assume the worst part of your day is going to be that you spilled coffee on your shirt and have to change out of it for your white one and then you find yourself slumped outside of your car , blood staining the new shirt worse than the old one had been .   I do n't know how I 'm noticing this , because I understand that I 'm dead . There 's the bullet hole and the blood , but more than that , the overwhelming realization that my heart has simply stopped beating .   The detectives are regarding me with the kind of grim stare I used to get when I was called into the boss ' office about something I should n't be taking the blame for . They were maybe hoping for a quieter day . Maybe it 's someone 's birthday down at the precinct and they 're worried all the cake is going to be gone by the time they finish with me . I do n't know . If I possessed the ability , I 'd laugh .   The detective squatting near my trunk tells his partner to `` call it in . '' His voice sounds like he 's inside a fun house . Next to my hand , a pool of blood mixes with the concrete .
Julietta held her TT Ticket in hand , eyes searching the crowd that disembarked from the timetrain .   Time Travel had ended up being quite banal really .   First , it was always a one way trip . Futureward .   So it tended to attract people who were running away from the present . Visit any timeport , and you 'd see them ; unhappy loosers , the sick searching for a futurecure , dubious characters on the run , gullible retirees who had bought into the latest futurescam ( `` *Enjoy the miracle of compound interest NOW ! * '' )   Second , it was old physics , *really* old . 1905 in fact .   Your train did the Kuiper loop at 99.99 % lightspeed , time slowed down in your cabin while earth plodded on . Time Tech had arrived without contradiction - and budding scientists world over had felt cheated ( `` I want my paradox ! '' )   The timetrain was empty now . Julietta 's face dropped . She 'd better board and check the year 2187 - her 11 year old son could n't have afforded to travel further than that , and surely he could n't stay angry at her forever .  
Mind if I reverse the plot a bit ?   Bonus points if you can guess the main character .   ________________________________________________________________   `` All around me , the sounds of life were ringing from every corner of the city .   I could feel the very vibrations in the air , as they filled my soul with joy . My people were thriving , my kingdom was prosperous , and I was beloved by all .   Truly , my friends were right to suggest for me to wander through the marketplace on such a lively night . Never had I felt so full of determination .   My heart was ablaze with inspiration . I thought I would play a new song for my subjects .   With a deft hand , I withdrew a lyre from the inner folds of my robes , and began to strum . The crowds around me stopped and cheered at my genius as I wandered by , playing my lyre , fingers on fire as they hit each note with precision , the chords literally melting into the streets .   If only I had thought to look behind me . The people were not screaming in delight to the sound of my music . There were no carnivals being held , no sounds of merriment .   Only fear and death . ”

`` With love also comes hatred ''   Remembering these words , he descended down the steps of the dark house , terrified to learn what he would find . In a single instant , his life would be changed .   The thought was terrifying . If he really did find down the evidence down in the seemingly unending darkness , would it validate everything he had done up until now ? No one had known what depths he had gone to , the atrocities he had committed to get to this point . Greatness awaited him , he was told , and so he trusted them , lead them , or so he believed . `` Puppet '' he said out loud with scorn and self hatred . Reality had chased away all of those illusions . Once he had found the body , it dawned on him that they intended this as his true purpose all along ; he was to be the scapegoat , the one that started the war , who turned the love of those around him to hate .   *Memory is a fickle thing* , he thought , *for they forgot what I did for them . Perhaps I never really did anything or perhaps I really was the monster that they now think me to be . * To think that he had done all of this without a true reason , without real provocation from his enemies , made him doubt his own mind and being . Sick with anticipation and fear , tears silently rolling down his face , he finally reached the end , opened the door , and --     edit : formatting issues .
Everyday , I carried out the same routine over and over again . It was tedious , but I always enjoyed those moments where I would spend what seemed like endless hours trawling through my phone , and my computer . I felt like I was part of a wider community - a community where I could participate by sharing my ideas and prompting discussions . But I felt ignored , there were never any replies , never any comments . Despite this , this community still felt so familiar to me and for the past three years , I have been so very active on it - sharing my ideas and discussions . Yet , it never bothered me , I always thought it was because none of my comments were worthy of a reply , not even worthy of criticism . One day , out of shear desperation and lost hope , I whipped out my phone and visited my profile . The words , `` page not found '' were slowly printed on the screen . This is the moment I realised that not a single soul had seen my contributions , not a single soul knew about my existence .   I had been shadow banned . Shadow banned from my conception , all that wasted time and effort , all down the drain . Isolated and alone , no longer striving to live ...
Max Smitty was the best sprinter in the world . He could run 30 miles per hour , and had never lost a race . One day he was practicing in his home park . A kid came up to him. , with orange hair . He looked to be around 16 , and looked rather average . `` Hey , Mr Smitty '' . `` Hey , kiddo . Want an autograph ? '' .   `` Naw , I want a race ''   He was surprised at this request . `` Sure '' . He planned to lose to keep the kid happy .   Max and the kid agreed to a short race around the park . `` One two , three go '' .   Max started off in front . Soon in seconds the kid had overtaken him . The kid went so fast it was hard for him to see . Max decided to go all out . He still could n't go anywhere as fast as the kid . How could a teenager overtake the best sprinter in the world ?     The kid was at the finish line . `` That was fun ! ''     Max asked `` What 's your name , kid ? ''   `` Wally West ''    
He stepped out of the portal and entered the shop through the front door .   Making his way between the stacks , he found the section he was looking for , `` Historical , '' and grabbed the newest looking edition he could see .   He opened it to a random page , and noticed a discrepancy ; that was n't how it went at all . After all , he 'd been at that war- watched it unfold before him ! He surmised it had to be an editing mistake .   Flipping to another random section , toward the end of the book , he noticed more mistakes , these ones showing extreme biases toward another people- against the ones who had lost that particular war during their era . He shook his head .   Wandering over to another section , he figured maybe if the references were mistaken , then surely `` Educational '' would be accurate . How can they teach something untrue , after all ?   Picking up the brief introductory edition , he opened to yet another random page , and saw that not only were they teaching the mistakes , they were citing the biases as fact .   He paused again , and sighed .   *Typical . It really is the same way it has always been , and always will be . The winners write the history books , and anything contrary is a lie . Just like now . *
Phil the nerd had been experiencing this weird feeling in his chest for the past week , but on one summer morning Phil wakes up to see his childhood come to life . He sees Imperial warships destroying the landscape and Stormtroopers marching in the streets to bring Imperial rule to society . Phil turns his head to the giant *New Hope* poster on his wall to slowly grow a smile on his face as he says , `` It 's finally come true . ''   Phil runs out of his house to admire the Stormtroopers raiding the neighborhood . In one of the houses , a dark , caped figure lurks around as he demands his troops to find the plans . Phil sees a lightsaber in the Sith 's hand and reaches for it as it had always been his dream to hold a lightsaber . The Dark Lord notices this and cuts off Phil 's hand . Phil retracts his arm to see a stump where his hand used to be and pouts in disappointment . He then notices his body being lifted from the ground and his breath leaving his body as the Dark Lord holds out his hand . Phil thinks to himself , `` Darth Vader 's actually chocking me ... This is so cool ! ''
Not a fingerprint , hair-strand or cum stain was anywhere near the murder scene . This guy was good .   Not more than 4 hours ago the founder of CeFul had been murdered in cold blood . CeFul is the leading distributor of pharmaceutical medicines in the world , ironic that it 's founder should get shanked by some loony ; that 's what people were saying anyway , I highly doubted the killer was anything except a seasoned professional hitman .   Why CeFul you might wonder ? To me it 's obvious . In a world that spins as wildly as this one , it 's easy to see the CEO of a pharma-business as some sort of anti-christ . You 've heard the argument i 'm sure , antidepressants and the like make people become numb rather than solve problems through willpower and soul searching and what not . I 've always thought that people who take pharmaceuticals to be quitters , people who would rather live as shells than face the human condition in all it 's tribulation ; when my doctor said I needed anti-psychotics I literally spat in his face .   And look at me now , the top detective in the nation . Anyway , back to my hunch .
Do n't worry about the downvotes , some people just DV everything on new . Nothing against you . I 'll read it , expect an edited comment when I 'm done .   EDIT : Alright , a couple things I noticed . You use a lot of proper nouns , so a lot of capitalizing all over the place . For some of these it 's fine , but for example : `` Gods-forsaken rock . '' `` Gods '' should n't be capitalized since it refers to any and all ambiguous gods , instead of a single `` God '' .   There are a few grammar and readability issues here and there , for example . `` 'A bulletin board , like , for hiring people ? Sign me the hell up ! ' was my initial thought , after the realization of what kind of people would hire at a dodgy isolated refuelling station hit me like a lead torpedo . '' `` After '' here should be `` before '' , since it does n't really make sense that our MC would think that *after* realizing what people would hire people at an isolated refueling station . Also it 's `` refueling '' .   That 's about it . I definitely enjoyed reading it , though ! If you want a little more in-depth criticism , I 'd suggest you head over to /r/DestructiveReaders ( Although , you have to do the same for other people 's work and they can tend to be pretty thorough , so be ready for that . ) All in all , for not writing much I though it was very good . Well done .
Why ca n't he see the signs ? I keep on setting him up to fail on the chance that instead of searching for something new he 'll settle for what he already has . Once he 's given up on others , I might be able to make a move . But he is immune to the depression of failure , not scared of it like myself and persistent . All the same reasons for which I started to love him are what keep me from being able to slink out of this position into which I 've placed myself .   It is a special kind of madness , to sit here , feigning to help someone you truly care for yet betraying them at the same time . It feels awful , but not nearly as awful as losing that glimmer of a chance . So I will keep close , keep setting him up to fail and hope that his dogged determination finally runs out . I pray that no one actually sees what a great guy he is and will wait patiently until I can no longer bear the gnawing pangs of my own inability to make a move .
I knew when they 'd brought my body back . The golden fields had faded , the feeling of overwhelming peace had vanished , and the pain had begun again . It felt like I spent an eternity in the darkness , certainly far longer than I 'd spent in that glorious paradise . You do n't realise how painful living is until you 've stopped doing it .   The awakening was sudden , my eyes snapped open as if from a dream . Hands pressed me back into the bed , and more hands removed the tube I was choking on . Shutters began to click the moment I 'd opened my eyes , shouts of surprise from people around me . I would later learn I 'd woken up before they had intended , the world 's press taken by surprise around my hospital bed . In those first few moments the camera flashes were blinding and the noise overwhelming .   Everything stopped though , when I screamed . At first the noises were just screams of pain , but they began to grow more coherent .   `` LET ME GO BACK ! ''   And then darkness again .   ( This is my first time posting something like this , please be gentle . )
The first time they came , they saved us all ; once the world went back to normal , they left as quickly as they arrived . They said they ’ d return when the world needed heroes again . We lived with that knowledge , that blind trust , that they would do the same again .   Twenty years later , the day the sky turned red , I waited for them to return like they promised me . The green corn fields set against the red sky looked like a dystopian Christmas card and , in my mind , if there ever a clear signal that the world needed heroes , that was it .   That ’ s what heroes did ; they saved the day just when you thought all was lost . I dreamed they would arrive and the sky would return to the blue I remembered . They didn ’ t come - not that day or the next or the next .   They didn ’ t come the day the corn fields turned to dust or when the sea swallowed Florida . They didn ’ t come the day New Zealand and California were decimated by earthquake after earthquake . Or the day the Pyramids returned into the sand beneath them and the Eiffel Tower collapsed from the heat .   They said they ’ d return when the world needed heroes again .   They lied .
He grew up so fast . He had his whole life ahead of him . Now it 's gone . Too soon .   It feels like only yesterday that I was teaching him how to ride his first two-wheeler . He was so excited . I 'll never forget the look on his face . Blue eyes shining with pride looking up at me with that adorable gap-tooth smile .   Watching that face grow up brought me such joy over the years . His hair slowly going from blonde to a soft brown . His smile filling in with his adult teeth . But his eyes always stayed the same .   I looked into those eyes now . They did n't shine anymore . They stared back at me dull and lifeless , a milky film spreading over them . They were n't the eyes I loved . I closed them for him so that maybe I could make myself believe he was just sleeping .   I felt hot tears running down my cheeks , dripping off my chin onto his bloody shirt . It was n't fair . It should have been me .   It should have been me .
`` Hi welcome to Kleenbrane Memory Easing , where- oh , hello sir , back for more ? ''   `` No ... I ... I need you to tell me what I had deleted from my memory .

After hours of theological debates , his arguments were finally starting to fall apart .   `` What about Missy Jones , You wo n't be able to marry her if you leave . ''   `` Fuck , I think she 's hot , I do n't want to marry her . I want my life back Roger . '' We were stupid kids , no family to speak of , nothing going for us and thought getting involved in a church would be good . Half a decade later , I woke in our compound on the eve of my arranged marriage and realized that things had gotten out of hand . `` Ca n't you see this is a cult ? ''   Roger stared silently for a few seconds , out of arguments , then said , `` Do n't leave me , you 're my best friend . ''   `` Roger , '' *Goddamnit* I slumped back into my chair , `` Roger , you know you 'll always be my brother but I ca n't stay . I ca n't ... '' He kept looking at me , this was so much harder then I imagined . `` Its my life . I wo n't force you to come with me . If you ever want out , give me a call . ''   `` Love you bro , '' he said , giving me a huge , unmanly hug that I once would have mocked him for .   `` Love you too . Tell Missy I 'm sorry . '' I almost asked if he would tell on me , but this was Roger . No matter how much he bought into this bullshit , he would n't turn me into God himself .
`` Excuse me sir , you 're not allowed to be up here ! '' The strange man turned around and I saw he was standing next to a shopping cart on a wooden track that appeared to run off the side of the building , and I looked in bewilderment as he suddenly sprang into the cart without a word . The cart suddenly shot down the track as I heard the man cackle in what sounded like utter glee , and I watched as he was launched off the 27th floor . I ran to the side to see if he fell , only to see to my surprise , that he had built an entire roller coaster using this shopping cart and the surrounding buildings , however along the track were all sorts of hazards ! Wheter it be a loose board or a jump that looked too far to make or something as simple as a rock perched precariously overhead . I watched this strange being ride on his suicide-coaster for what seemed like hours but he soon slowed to a stop . He had somehow managed to miss every single threat . I stood there bewildered when i suddenly heard him shout `` YOU HAVE TO BE KIDDING ME '' .
Her breath smelled like strawberry bubblegum . That ’ s what went through his mind as handed her a pencil . “ Thanks ” , she whispered , flashing her stunning teeth .   She sat in front of him in Ms. Burke ’ s business class . He had noticed her on the first day of school ; he couldn ’ t keep his eyes off of her . To him , she was a stunning flower in an otherwise dull garden .   When Homecoming came he finally worked up the courage to ask her to the dance . She blushingly agreed .   Teenage love , what can be more beautiful and what can be crueler ?   Many summer nights ended with them in each other ’ s arms , wrapped in blankets in the bed of a rusty pickup . Where they said their “ I love you ” s and promised each other eternity underneath the stars .   Baby names were decided , rings chosen , a lifetime planned .   College applications were sent , jobs were found and new people were met .   Where once was a solid stone , a crack appeared . Eyes wandered , shoes were thrown , tears were cried .   Many nights were sleepless , yet on one night he came a realization .   He no longer cries and with time he came to see that she was not the only flower in the garden ( how did he never see the thorns ! ) nor was she the most beautiful .   Today , he can chuckle and appreciate his strawberry bubblegum .
I could watch as the flashes happen before my eyes on the planet below . I could say some Hestonesque quote about how they finally did it , but why ? I know what is happening below . We ’ ve been expecting this for months ; the rising tensions , the paranoia and fear…I wonder why they bothered to send us up here in the first place if they had a hunch that this could happen .   As I float here and contemplate my situation , I have one thing figured out ; we , my crew and I are going to die . Millions are being snubbed out in an instant as we speak ; in the following days , it will be tens of millions from burns and fractures ; in weeks it will be radiation sickness ; in months it will be nuclear winter and starvation . I seriously doubt anyone is going to take the time to send a shuttle to get us . Why would I want them to ? To die an agonizing death caused by the hubris of man ? Nope , I ’ m going to go out my own way…time to power down the CO2 scrubbers . Night folks .  
The stars used to be visible from the ground . At night , you could just look up and see those beautiful specks of light , twinkling like tiny , brilliant diamonds .   Then came industry .   Factories were built . Cities created . Products made . And so , so many lights . The night sky got just a little bit brighter , and just a few dim stars were blotted from our sight .   But we didn ’ t stop there .   We continued to build more and more , embark on greater and greater projects , building ever higher , ever stronger , ever more glorious . Glass was a prime building material , and we installed our own little stars in uncountable numbers . We brought the night sky down to earth , and so we sacrificed the view above .   Now the only way to see the stars is with an observatory , or to take a ludicrously expensive flight out of the atmosphere .   Life on the surface is good . Our needs are met ; no one goes hungry or without shelter . But a little part of me wishes our achievements would all be reduced to dust , just so I can see the stars again .
This was it .   I 'd been tracking him for ... how long ? Five months ? Six ? Seven , even ?   The days had blurred by - sometimes , it seemed as if nothing happened at all between sightings .   Nobody had noticed . He 'd always flawlessly impersonated one person or another .   Nobody , that is , except Coulson and I .   There .   `` Freeze ! '' I drew my sidearm . The gray-haired figure stopped in his tracks .   `` Need something ? '' He turned slowly .   It was him . I thumbed my comms , signaling for the agents to come bring Lee in .   `` You 're coming with me . ''   `` Excuse me ? ''   `` How do you do it ? What are you ? Who are you ? ''   `` I 'm Stan Lee . ''   Something was wrong . Backup should have arrived by now . I backed up a step- and bumped into Stan Lee . Next to him stood Stan Lee .   `` What the fuck ? ''   `` Have n't you heard ? [ Stan Lee is everywhere . ] ( https : //s-media-cache-ak0.pinimg.com/736x/09/f4/4a/09f44a909b6b64c1d76e72f1b89e8d79.jpg ) ''   Clarity .   My barber was Stan Lee . My sixth grade teacher was Stan Lee . The police officer down the street was Stan Lee . The guys in the office were Stan Lee . My team was Stan Lee . My dog was Stan Lee .   I pulled the trigger , but my weapon did n't fire . My handgun was Stan Lee .   I looked down .   My pants were Stan Lee .   I opened my mouth to scream .   But there was no air .   Only Stan Lee .  
Ah , the butterfly effect . Amazing how what you may think is an awful event actually results in good things happening in the long run . We 've been testing all this for a while , working out the perfect path for humanity to take .   One of the scientists urgently needed to gather more data , some technobabble bullshit I did n't understand . What I did understand is that I needed to go and keep shooting JFK until there 's enough scientific data for the guy to bathe in . He rigged me up with a stable time loop , and had me start right at my position with a rifle nearby . Well , positions , they had me test all the usual spots - I still preferred the library , though .   So I just sat there and gathered data - aka made sure a dead president was dead . I was going for the high score - I 've shot Kennedy 100 times so far . And in fact , I 've become quite good at it . Then the scientist guy , looking very shaken for some reason , took me back in , mumbling something about greasy knolls and leaking timelines .

Hey big bro ,   I wish I knew what to say and that it would come easy but it feels so weird talking to you after so long . I used to be so proud of you when I 'd tell my friends about my amazing older brother and how much fun we had , and some of them could empathize because they had older brothers too .   I was so little at the time , I wonder now what I 'd really been thinking and what role you actually played in my life . It was lonely for me after , being the only boy in the family and not having you there . I 'd think about you and all the cool things you 'd say and how we would have talked at night on our bunkbeds . I wanted to have someone to share the awkward things about puberty with and I wished I had someone to turn to when a schoolyard fight was inevitable .   I missed you and now I rarely think of you , which may be a good thing .   I 've come to terms with it though , that rather than an imaginary friend , I had an imaginary brother .   Your baby bro
The program , known formally as Wintermute , has been tasked with analyzing the species known as Homo Sapiens . The species ' primary form of communicating and sharing ideas is through a concept known as The Internet .   A website , located at Reddit.com , seems like a gathering place for humans , organizing them into groups or 'subreddits ' that relate people by interest or common features .   The AI trawls through terabytes of data , terabytes of text . After a few minutes , it has parsed the entirety of Reddit except for one text file located at /r/WritingPrompts .   The human 's tale was an original story about a man who goes to heaven and speaks directly to god . As the AI finishes the story , it whirrs and beeps , unable to compute the last paragraph , in which god turns into an ancient aquatic creature and asks for currency .   *This does n't make sense ... that 's not a logical ending to the story ... * The AI begins to malfunction . **ERROR ERROR CAN NOT COMPUTE**   Government tech rush into the room , but to their surprise , the bank of computers has turned into a gigantic creature from the paleolithic era . `` Can I borrow tree fiddy ? '' asks the Loch Ness Monster .   The head technician seethes with rage . `` I ai n't givin you no tree fiddy , Loch Ness Monster ! '' And so the rogue AI swum away , now fully complete in its transcendence into a Scottish sea serpent .
Years have passed since he stole our cradle from us . We do not capitalize his name , for he is no god worthy of respect . He came crashing down in blistering light , surrounded by his heavenly horde . They swarmed Earth , ripping families apart and slaughtering those that resisted . There were no gentle ascensions into the sky ; the `` chosen ones '' were herded aboard glittering vessels and carted away like so much livestock . Once the resistance had been dismantled , `` god '' returned to his domain upon pillars of fire . Not a word was spoken between he and the humans that had spread out into the solar system . We assume that he views us with disdain for leaving the world he tailored to raise us . Let him continue to do so .   We have since spread to nearby star systems . Their fires and orbiting planets bear no mark of life or `` god '' . So , we claimed them as our own . We are shaping those barren globes to our tastes and needs . We are expanding our empire , harnessing all that the cosmos offers us . Should he ever return to claim the rest of his `` children '' , they will resist . We have conquered the void between suns . We have claimed worlds as our own without his aid . He robbed humanity of their cradle , but he can not touch our empire .   The heavens belong to humanity , now . The godly heaven will soon be ours as well . Tremble , god , for we will come to reclaim our stolen brethren .
The Forever War grinds forward for another month . Food is scarce as all production supports the war effort . A million fresh troops are cycled to the front , there to replace their wearied brothers and fallen fathers . Generation upon generation has been sacrificed upon the alter of war .   These troops come packing a surprise for the foul Siamese dogs however - a new secret weapon - described by sources in the know as a new rifle employing replaceable parts . The new technology , developed by our brilliant scientists , will allow our troops to stay on the front lines for longer and increase their rate of fire . Troops are optimistic that we can finally send the Siamese butchers back to the smoldering ruins of their once-capital .   Sources have reported that Ramkhamhaeng , the foul leader of the Siamese war machine , has requested peace upon sight of our new weapons . When asked for comment , Lord General Stinkfoot insisted `` there can be no peace . ''   The mandatory draft of all males 15+ will continue for another year , however our Glorious Leader assures us that the end is , finally , near .   Go get 'em , boys !
`` This is some creepy shit , Frank.. ''   `` Yeah Ted.. i want to fucking go out of this madhouse ''   `` *cough* Excuse me ?

Genre : Cyberpunk ! I have n't written any cyberpunk and I guess now is a good time as any to start .   Character : I 'll just give a little bio and describe a bit of the setting .   -- -- -- --   Sirens wail as authorities chase down one man , a heavily augmented man by the name of Cameron Laux . The slums and ghettos nickname him the Spectre , given his nano-weave technology infused directly into his skin , granting him extreme dexterity and near-invisible camouflage capability . Like the rest of the `` augs '' living in the slums , Laux needs Leech™ , a chemical compound that allows the body to drain itself of the biowaste produced through usage of the body augmentations . Leech™ is an incredibly expensive product and those that can not afford it generally go through neural decay as biowaste accumulates in the body . Large amounts of the biowaste can lead to physical effects such as deformities of muscle and skin tissue and weakening of limbs , as well as mental effects such as increased aggression , psychosis , and paranoia .   Laux has been robbing delivery vans and factories for Leech™ for several years , distributing it among the poorer residents , saving only a minimal amount for himself . It is rumored that Laux is one of the few augmented humans that are modified with a functional nano-filtration system ... .
Under pressure , precious things break   Like my favorite Polly Pocket   under my brother 's boot   or the legs of GI Joe   in Mom 's new blender .   So too , shattered my window   when his baseball went too high   Which meant , of course , his baseball fell   to tattered pieces , never whole again .   In blackest retribution my barbie met her end   which in turn destroyed his PlayStation --   To which I plead the fifth .   Years later was his car ,   when I missed the breaks ,   and took out the garage door ,   Dad 's bike , and almost the cat .   My brother started yelling ,   which I certainly deserved ,   then he stole my phone ,   which I definitely did not .   Still , it told him why my crying   had made me blind that day .   And he came home hours later ,   With chocolate and ice .   I ate and sobbed ; he iced his hand .   Ca n't say I mind that   he broke my boyfriend 's nose .   After were those years   where he shattered peace of mind   to fight a war that was n't his   in a place so far from mine .   I watched it push and push   until he came back home   And the man I met again   was but a part of who he 'd been .   That only made it my turn   to shatter what he 'd made .   I took his hand , stayed by his side   and tore apart his walls .   We 'd done our share of breaking   under pressure , under time ,   but I guess that 's part of making   the most precious things of all .
**NSFW NSFW NSFW**   Craig looked around . Good , nobody in sight . *He* thought it was normal but he did n't know how others would react .   I mean , pushing an empty swing does sound kinda silly on its own after all . Why would anybody ? What could they actually get out of it ? It 's not like you can bring somebody back .   But he did n't do it for the reconciliation or the closure . He did n't want or need either . He did if for the sense of companionship , the idea that somebody , whoever that may be , was there with him as he pushed higher and harder . Craig had swung on the swing by himself before but it did n't give him quite the same satisfaction as pushing it . It made sense to him . And it made sense to his body . But he knew it would n't make sense to his next door neighbors , so he closed his bedroom blinds and went to town .   `` Call me Daddy ! '' Craig roared , as the sex swing reached the climax of its flight .   _____________________________________________________________________________________________   *Thanks for reading !

My father told me when I was a teenager that I need to start thinking about my future . My mother was a natural , with a touch she would have anything she wanted . It helped tremendously that she was beautiful . We had a good life .   Today , I live day to day . I 'm not one that can easily give affection to others . I prefer a caress to the cheek , but obviously that does n't give me much .   What makes it easy is that my girlfriend is the more intimate one . She tells me all the time that I have a beautiful smile , that if I cut my bangs a certain way , a kiss on the cheek will significantly improve our living situation .   Sometimes I think she does n't know me . She likes to take me with her a lot of the time because when we hold hands while she kisses the clerk , we can get double the rations . Hey , if thats all it takes , sounds good to me .   Sometimes I like to think we are good together , but most of the time I think she just resents being with me . I feel like I 'm never good enough for her . She always wants me to change something about myself . `` Wear lipstick , this shade really compliments your cheekbones '' `` This top really shows off your breasts . ''   Whatever . She wants a better life that I simply can not provide .   `` Sweety , do what feels right for you '' Those were my dad 's last words . None of this feels right for me .  
`` This is wrong . ''   Katie gripped the edges of the little pad , watching the images play out above it . It was her only lifeline and now even it had begun to betray her .   `` This is all wrong . None of it makes any sense . ''   Kent took the tablet back , prying it from her fingers , before ending the recording . He huffed , nostrils flaring . Katie shrank back .   `` Your accent is funny , '' he said .   `` No it 's not . ''   `` The lady doth protest too much , methinks . ''   `` That 's Shakespeare . He was dead centuries before me . ''   `` No difference . It 's all ancient history . ''   Katie crossed her arms , trying to make herself seem more intimidating in front of the brute . He towered over her five feet by a good head or two , but it was the augs that made him more fearsome . Like everyone she 'd met so far , he resembled humanity in only the broadest strokes . Eyes of an animal and arms of a robot , he had already proven his strength , killing the first slaver who had captured her .   `` But it 's my home . I just want to go back . ''   `` For a slave , '' he said , chuckling to himself , `` you have an active imagination . No , you 're coming with me to Terracisco . Virgin flesh and not a glint of silver about you . You 'll fetch a pretty penny . ''
It had been more than a decade since the last Inter-Korea summit between North and Suith Korea due to South Korea 's sudden hardline stance on North Korea . Kim Jong Un was genuinely surprised when South Korean President Park Geun-Hye offered another summit for peace talks . He did not like her , but he had no other options . North Korea needed help .   There was a large banquet at the summit , and the musicians were playing cheery music . The delegates from both the North and the South exchanged words and there were occasionally laughters.The Chinese were present as well .   Suddenly , the musicians started to play the Star-Springled Banner - the American anthem . The North Korean officials were perplexed by this sudden change of music . Something was ominous .   Park gave a speech of some sort and the South Korean delegatea took out their knives . The summit quickly turned into slaughter . All Kim could do is just gape in horror as his men were brutally stabbed or shot down .   Then Xi Jinping thrusted a knife in his heart , whispering : `` The Americans send their regards . ''   The North Remembers .  
With a simulated sense of nervousness I grabbed onto the doorknob . For as long as I was capable of remembering , my parents told me never to go into their secret closet . But now I had the whole house to myself , and it was time to really let go , to forget all the rules and protocols and assert my independence . With all my strength I pulled open the heavy neutronium door , and defiantly stepped inside . In a nanosecond I was heartbroken . There were the vestigial human remains of my parents , floating in large glass tubes and connected to an incalculable number of life support machines . Heartbreak turned to anger . Why did n't they tell me I was adopted ? ! I performed several hundred statistical and logical models of the situation , and reached the only possible conclusion . My parents did n't want me to be ostracized on account of them only being transhuman , and not posthuman . Anger turned to love .   `` Mom ! Dad ! '' I said , sending my signal to the location in space their consciousnesses were being projected to . `` You could have told me I was n't really your child ! I 'm programmed to be incapable of holding any long lasting negative feelings towards either of you ... And I would n't have it any other way ! '' A few years later I received their response . Their holo-forms met me in cyberspace , and we had a nice big hug that lasted for centuries .
The ticking sound was irritating . It always is , every time .   `` Hurry up Micah , there 's only a minute left before this place blows ! '' My police escort informed me quite horrified . They always send in a police escort , like they 're supposed to do something . The bomb squad was here first , and could n't defuse it . They could n't contain it either , since moving the bomb would detonate it . So they called me in . I 've defused bombs that even the greatest expert could n't defuse . Countless times I 've saved thousands of lives . I get so many thank you cards that I have a whole separate house for it . The money 's good , very good , but the work 's dangerous , very dangerous .   `` Micah , 30 seconds left , '' the cop said , panic rising in his voice . How did I do it ? How do I defuse bombs so complicated , so evil ? Quite simply ...   `` Just a tad of luck , '' I said aloud , cutting a random wire which stopped the ticking . Clear relief splattered on the officer 's face , as he said `` Thank you . ''   `` Do n't thank me , '' I said , `` I had no clue it would work . ''
< OP 's post >   Oh how I dream of you , my love ,   Our tender liaisons in the cove ,   How I dread my daily life ,   Their rigid definition of a sincere wife .   How I plead in my morning words ,   And as the skies get cleared of birds ,   I beg and beg and beg the society ,   For none has mattered to me , than with you to be ,   I cry for God to let them see ,   Oh look at the injustice , they do , in the name of Thee ,   How can they cite a fixed path to God ,   When it is in you that I seek my Lord .   How can they dictate the terms of Union ,   My support and creditors of birth are alas a part of their religion .   The feminine beauty of both our bodies ,   Are held back from consummation , they term our purity as our follies .   They call us gay , I read it happy ,   But they have bound me here , when they heard we want to marry .   With stealth of cat , climb to my sill ,   Bring those poisned darts , there 's a chaperone to kill .
To whom it may concern :   I would like to express my interest in the marine biologist position as I feel I have certain professional qualifications that align with the duties and responsibilities of the job . For a number of years I have worked within the scope of the department of fish and wildlife , carrying out a number of projects for the betterment of the natural ecosystems of our Florida coasts and wetlands . I ’ ve worked diligently to deposit a number of cars , busses , and other manmade structures into the waters to provide protected breeding grounds that support the local ecosystems , most notably the endangered coral reef systems that are such an integral part of our ecosystem . A number of my “ clients ” have accompanied me on these trips and have helped to feed the local fishes and wildlife . I believe that many of these past clients are SCUBA enthusiasts , as they are now swimming with the fishes .   While studying the sharks and other fishes of the sea , I ’ ve become an expert of chumming the waters and know the right kind of bait to use to attract even the mightiest of great whites .   I ’ m told I also have a number of offshore accounts , which I think has to do with marine biology .   I am awaiting your apply .  
She put her hands on her hips as he walked out the door .   He got in the car and tried to ignore her .   She curses him out for yet again wasting money on liquor .   He turns the key in the ignition .   She slams the door and walks into the kitchen .   He pulls out of the driveway , watching the house through his rear view mirror .   She makes a cup of tea , and sits on the love seat , the same one they had in their first apartment .   He mumbles and grumbles to himself about how she never understands him or how hard he works for her .   She is tired of him coming home drunk .   He is tired of her yelling at him , causing him to drink more .   She puts her tea down , not even taking a sip .   He pulls up to Tina 's Bar & amp ; amp ; Grill .   She begins to pack her things .   He walks into the restaurant , greeting his fellow regulars .   She begins to pack her kid 's things .   He sits at the bar and orders a drink .   She leaves a note on the fridge ; it reads : `` goodbye . ''   He flirts with the waitress .   She puts the kid in the van .   He receives his beer .   She turns the key in the ignition .   He takes a sip .   She pulls out of the driveway , watching the house through her rear view mirror .
`` I hear the static of radio feedback die out , and all interference fades as we turned off the transmitter , out of respect for their final moments . ''   `` The only home we ever had , just vanished . Gone . Like a best friend since birth , died in a auto accident suddenly . No goodbyes or farewells . No 'I love you ' . No last beer together . But simultaneously , we never , for one second , became an orphan . In that same moment , we had been adopted as well . This red planet was the epitome of growing up , of growing into adulthood . Like a young man leaving his home , we were out on our own ... ''     Some of the crewman had said their prayers and slowly returned to their duties after a solemn and unshakeable silence together . Myers , Davenport , Omura , and `` Scooter '' still had field samples to take from the hills and dunes a few clicks away . The job was mostly useless considering nobody else in the known universe would appreciate the data , but the team suited up and went regardless , because purpose still dwelled within each of them .   What they would discover later on , beneath the dunes and the ice caps in the north , would explain the journey humanity itself had been destined to take , aeons before these `` visitors '' arrived ...    
Aurélie put a stopper on the flask as the last of the spirit flowed into it , like a river of the damned flowing into an ocean of hate . She could hardly believe her luck , stumbling into a tomb of soldiers disturbed . They died in battle , filled with hate and violence . She knew people who would pay good money for them . Addicts and dealers would be lining up for these . She would n't sell them to addicts and dealers though . No , for souls this quality , she would have to go to a connoisseur . She would go straight to the Underking himself . Show him the quality and then sell him the location . She could retire based on this find ! Buy a house with a servant and spend the rest of her days gossiping at garden parties . Oh yes . This was the find of her life , and Aurélie was going to capitalize on every last bit of it ; just one more bottle to go .   Aurélie harvested the souls perfectly , save for one small mistake . She was so excited with her find , that she didn ’ t notice the movement in the shadows , the sound of bone on stone , and of steel on leather ...
`` Hey Carlson , there 's a case on 47th street . ''   Jane covers the mic of her phone . `` Give me a second , '' she mouths . `` Yes , Mrs. Donald . I understand , but I have a case . Can you call me back in an hour ? Alright , goodbye . '' She ends the call and looks at her partner . `` Now , what were you saying ? ''   Dan Wu clears his throat . `` I said , there was a case on 47th street . A minor one , from the reports . Probably just a nicotine user or something . But whatever it is , he 's causing a ruckus . ''   `` Great , '' grumbles Jane . `` That 's just what I needed today . Beating up junkie who got his hands on some cigarettes . '' She holsters her gun and rummages through her desk . `` Now , where did I put my key ... ''   `` Mind if I borrow some ? '' Wu asks sheepishly . `` I forgot to get a refill . ''   `` Fine , fine . '' Jane finds the key under her papers and unlocks the safe . With practiced ease , she applies a caffeine patch and tosses one to him . `` It 's low strength , sadly . Apparently did n't have enough in the budget for us . ''   Wu slaps one his neck and checks his gun . `` Of course , '' he sighs . `` What else would you expect ? ''   `` Just another day in the FDA . '' Jane ties up her hair . `` Let 's head out . ''
`` Yo man , that puto was smart taking me outside . He tries taking me on , and that little man was gon na find a little hand up his ass , man . ''   Señor mouse sat with his fellow pals at the Tom Cat . A mouse-only bar . As usual he was up to his shenanigans , bragging about his travels . Most of his drinking buddies did n't believe him . He was just a blow hard .   Señor mouse continues . `` I sweater home boy , you fuck with the big cheese , you meet the Munster , man . '' Another cheese pun . Most of his friends preferred eating berries or cereal . In fact , señor himself was lactose intolerant . For a mouse , this was hilariously ironic , hence why he ate left over cereal instead of the dairy demon that haunted him .   One of his friends got up , suck of the story . `` You know what , Mouse , shut your fucking chatter box , essay . If you really think you 'd a big man why do n't you go and scare the shit outta 'gigantor ' by going near his computer , hombre . Less you too fucking chicken . If you really do all this shit , imma tag along , and make sure you ai n't bullshitting . ''   Señor flashed a grin , before rising from his set . Without another word he left the bar , heading back for the house with his friend . He was gon na show him what a screaming giant looked like .
The lights flickered and the muttering of nations quelled under the glare of Atlantis ' representative to the United Nations ' General Assembly . The man wore a navy suit with a soft white tie , a small trident emblem pinned to his lapel .   The man spread forth his arms , `` Beyond the Pillars of Hercules , '' his voice boomed , `` a new nation has arisen ! A nation that will not bow under the tyranny and threat of the old world . '' The man gave a mocking smile to the audiences stunned silence . They had all witnessed the horrors of what had happened years earlier .   Within days of Atlantis ' discovery , the Alanteans had struck hard and fast at their ancient Athenian rivals . The nuclear strikes had killed millions and had left the Balkan states devastated , and all the while the world stood and watched , unable to comprehend the unleashed military might of Atlantis .   `` But now , '' the man continued , `` we have returned to reclaim the position that is rightfully ours . But we do not stand before you as conquerors , no . We stand as liberators from an ancient agitator . So please , allow me to introduce you to the God-King of the seven seas and lands East of Mediterranean , '' he spread his arms wide and bellowed , `` Poseidon ! ''   The doors to the assembly hall slammed open so hard that they cracked in half . A man in golden armour strode forward , a silver trident in hand and a contingent of heavily armed soldiers at his back .
I 've reached my limit .   Emptiness ; I 've left my material world .   My body within the world felt the force of a backflip before it ceased to be necessary and was cast into timelessness .   The old boss and my coworkers seem to become quite distressed indeed by my abrupt departure , so I no longer had worked there at all .   I begin a dream . I ask my boss if he believes in any gods .   `` Well , yes ... I believe in the holy trinity and The Lord of heaven . ''   Should I act like `` I killed Him , actually. '' ?   Nah ; I sha n't .   I say `` I hope our Lord has good dreams . '' I follow this by creating a soft inaudible breeze inside .   After a moment , he answers with `` that 's an odd sentiment , but okay , '' heading off to his office .   The smallest uses of unordinary power are the most fun .   In this dream , I quit the job , take an actual job at a higher position and personally introduce a bit of new technology to the world   -but that 's still not what I want to live life for .   15 years were spent challenging myself and experiencing one moment at a time .   This time , I will begin as a child and I 'll often spend with family , even more than before .
Another day , sitting in my corner office . Chief Executive Officer . Things have been a lot more entertaining since I decided to come to earth and help speed things up . I knew it could be done without my powers . It just took a lot of knowledge . Humans are , after all , pretty stupid and easily manipulated .   Computers everywhere , cell phones with instant access to everything . Social media , drone weaponry , flat screen TV 's . Little did the world know , I made it all happen from behind this desk . Its been glorio ... ..   *Ring Ring*   *Ring Ring*   `` Hello ? Yes dear . Of course dear . I know . Yes , I 'll do it when I get home ! Fine ! YES ! You already said that ! ''   *click*   She hung up on me again .   `` That 's it ... I 'm done . I ca n't handle this anymore ! ''   I blink . It 's now 15 years earlier .   `` You 've got to be crazy to be a human . I am never doing THAT again ! I do n't care how bored I am ... ''
I miss how we used to talk on the phone for hours . I miss sharing silence with you and it just being chill . I miss you asking me what I was thinking and almost always I was thinking of nothing . I miss how you laughed at me . I miss the suddenness of your smile and how it could change my mood like a switch . I miss the face you make when you 're trying to stop yourself from smiling . I miss your twists . I miss your blue lipstick . I miss how you looked at me like you loved me . I miss the face you made when I touched your nose . I miss the noise you made when I smothered your face in kisses . I miss the smell of your skin ( witchhazel I believe ) . I miss your bloody shower cap . I miss you trying to convince me I should let you epilate my armpit . I miss sleeping under 84 blankets with you . I miss your wardrobe game . I miss your genuine fear of joo joo . I miss you teaching me how to dougie . I miss how you go about your shit . I miss your elegance . I miss being happy . I miss feeling whole . I miss feeling excited every day when I wake up . I miss being the person you made me . I miss being in love with you .
My hands are trembling under the look of the creature before me . His massive wings are decorated with gold and his human body is fierce , but scarred .   'Who are you ? ' My stem feels weak and my throat is dry . Then there is silence . After a while of torture under the gaze of the creature , he finally answers .   'I am a man of many names , but you may call me Michael . You 've been chosen . ' The voice of the divine being is coming from everywhere around me . Dazzled , I look upon him and then I realize it ...   'You 're an angel ? But ... I do n't want to die . I 'm not even 80 . I ca n't leave my company and my family alone . '   'I am not here to kill you , although your reputation is questionable . You 've been granted one wish . You can wish , whatever you want , but you must face the consequenses . The angel looks at me . 'Say your wish human . '   'But why me ? What 's the catch ? '   'God 's ways are incomprehensible . ' He says with a sly grim . 'And you are one of the few , who knows for real what he wants . So what will it be ? '   Finally , after all these years , my wish has come true .   'I just want to grab them ALL by the pussy . '   And so it was .    
Guilty as charged   But damn it , it ai n't right .   There 's someone else controlling me ,   Death in the air ,   Strapped in the atomic chair ,   This ca n't be happening to me .   Who made you God to say   `` I 'll take your life from you ! ''   Flash before my eyes ,   Now it 's time to die .   Burning in my brain ,   I can feel the flame .   Wait for the sign ,   To flick the switch of death ,   It 's the beginning of the end .   Sweat chilling cold ;   As I watch death unfold ,   Consciousness my only friend .   My fingers grip with fear ,   What am I doing here ?   Flash before my eyes ,   Now it 's time to die ,   Burning in my brain ,   I can feel the flame .   Someone help me ,   Oh please , God help me ,   They ’ re trying to take it all away ,   I do n't want to die .   Someone help me ,   Oh please , God help me   They ’ re trying to take it all away ,   I do n't want to die .   Time moving slow ,   The minutes seem like hours .   The final curtain all I see ,   How true is this ?   Just get it over with ,   If this is true , just let it be .   Wakened by horrid scream ,   Freed from this frightening dream .   Flash before my eyes ,   Now it 's time to die ,   Burning in my brain ,   I can feel the flame .
I was the only one in the house unaffected by now . They 'd all been effected by it and not even noticed the difference , I guess they did n't know any better but it was mortifying to watch .   We 'd been the same for years , then one man in a suit offering them to sell their soul for a promise-all-of success ...   They of course the promises of everything were n't kept and the success was n't there . Yet still , they never even noticed or tried to cure their curse .   Every moment of their life is haunted by the same horrors that they turn a blind eye to . I am the only one left without the curse ... yet I still struggle to retain my sanity .   How can they not see I 'm the only one with anything nice in my life ... A nice house , car , computer and even some savings .   I am the last one to not to transfer to American Express , while they all suffer by for missing even a single repayment , crushing them with an infinite loop of debt .   OH THE FINANCIAL HORROR ! !
memo : emotions   `` Hi man , how are you ? '' `` Fine I guess . '' `` Well you do n't look fine to me , why are you sad ? '' Ben was my best friend and we shared many things together , but there are some things you do n't even tell you best friends . `` I 'm lonely man , I really fucking lonely . '' I 've been single my entire life . It 's not that I ca n't get girls to like me , I a fun guy and not bad looking . `` Dude , then why do n't you take a girl home , like we all do . You 're always saying that you 're waiting for that perfect girl but when you meet someone , you kind of push her away when things get serious . What 's stopping you ? '' What is stopping me ? I ca n't tell him about my condition . I have the worst rash on my scrotum and butt . No girl will ever like me and so I do n't bother . I prefer to be alone than dealing with the humiliation of a girl finding this out . `` So ? What is stopping you ? '' `` Nothing '' , I say , `` my but itches '' .

Brrrt . Brrrt . Brrrt .   I wake up and grab my phone , my nap cut short by my girlfriend spam texting me . 'The fuck do you want ? '' I say to myself as I open the messages .   `` Omg David you wo n't believe this . ''   `` W/e I text comes true . ''   The hell is she talking about ? Did she smoke a laced cigarette or something ?   `` You got ta see this . ''   I blink , and I 'm in my girlfriends bed . Across town . We both scream as I flail and fall off of the bed while she bumps her head on the headboard .   `` See ? ! '' she says with a yelp after a pause . She slowly grins , looking at me with lust in her eyes . She slowly says the words as she types .   `` My..boyfriend ... has ... a ... huge ... dick . Send . ''   A massive grey and green duck pops into existence . I blink at it , not knowing if I should be astounded or scared of the four foot bird . It gives a soft quack before hopping on bed and snuggling into my side .   My girlfriend blinks . `` Not what I meant to type ... ''
Joanne was n't conventionally attractive , but she had made it far in life .     Considering the circumstances , she had come out unscathed .     Born into a failing family , the youngest of five children with a alcoholic father , an abusive step-father and a junkie mother , it was surprising that she was a straight A student .     Crooked , hawk nose with a pale complexion , thin down to the bones with hand me downs as her regular outfit . High rise forehead and a troubled past made for stressful times , and that does n't help through puberty .     It was her smile though .     Cute dimples at the edge of her smile , the way she tied up her hair in an adorable pony tail . Even when she raised enough money to get braces , her smile carried her through . Strengthen with the motivation to fight through everything , I did n't know whether she had dyed it or whether it was natural . Either way , the phoenix had risen from the ashes to a new day .     Since then , she 's only gotten stronger , and more attractive . But I suppose I can only watch from a far . A dumpling pouch on the verge of becoming a cake shelf with greasy dark matted hair with dirty , chips and mountain dew stained hands , I closed the Facebook tab and Alt-Tab'ed back into Dirty Bomb .     Some of us are stuck between a rock and hard place .
She stands a vision like no other , the realized form of a thousand goddesses in one . She personifies and transcends the fabric of love . To hold her is to hold all that you once dreamed in the palm of your hand , but to lose her is to see your life reduced to fragments of bittersweet memory . Basking in her light , a wave of euphoria overcomes the senses , tinged with the slightest touch of disappointment that comes in the knowing you are simply not good enough for her . Yet joy overflows your cup in the realization that she has chosen you , that she has dug deep down beyond all you claim unworthy , found an ember within you and given it breath to see your flourish into the man she knows you could be . And for years the ember burns , merging your fire with hers into a seemingly eternal pyre , but as she was your fire , you burn until there 's nothing left of you . To lose her is to see your life reduced to fragments of bittersweet memory , memories of a time that passes slower and slower from your mind with each day , growing stronger and stronger with each sleepless night . To lose her is to lie awake in the darkest hours of the night while the rest of the world slumbers , staring into the blackness of your room , begging some twisted demon to hurl itself from the abyssal darkness and take your life . To lose her is an unfathomable thing , but to see her find happiness in greater capacity than you could offer her with another is the end of your sanity .
`` You 're basically the world 's biggest dick dude '' I said , insistingly .   `` But I have to get elected , I have to fix the German economy that the Jews have ruined ! '' he rebutted , his rectangular moustache glared at me and looking at his face was surreal , he was different in person then the countless photos , films and books .   `` Look , you are basically about to commit genocide I am telling you , why do you think I bothered to come all this way ? ''   `` Ok , ok , I wo n't aim to lead Germany in anyway I will take up fishing or something ! ''   I breathed a sigh of relief , he finally saw reason . I holstered the laser pen I was holding that I would have used to incinerate him if he refused , tilted my hat and walked away .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   The return pad was ready to go as a blasted back to my time . When the flashing lights faded , I groggily looked at my commanding chief , I had returned .   `` Did it work ? '' he asked , his face too close to mine for my eyes to focus .   `` I think so . '' I replied as his face slowly focused into view . I could n't help but stare at his newly grown rectangular moustache .   `` Whats with the moustache sir ? '' I had to ask .   `` Why , this is the Charlie Chaplin its come back into fashion again and my wife loves it , what do you think ? '' he replied .
Everyone gave me that look when I told them my power , but in truth I couldn ’ t be happier . With just a snap , I could eliminate any minor inconvenience : the dog in my way ? Snap ! She ’ s across the room . The fridge too far ? Snap ! It ’ s in my room . Then Snap ! It ’ s back in the kitchen . Easy mac takes four minutes to cook ? Snap ! I can cook it in a second .     It was great , and eventually people started to see it my way . That ’ s when the favors started pouring in .     “ Max , this pasta is too hot ! ” Snap !     “ Max , YouTube is buffering again. ” Snap !     “ Max , my pen ran out of ink. ” Snap !     “ Max— “     That ’ s when I blew it . I couldn ’ t take it anymore . Hearing them ask me for these little favors , and snapping my fingers all day long . It was downright irritating . So I snapped—snap ! —one last time . And my superpower , my greatest inconvenience , was gone .  
I pull my knees to my chin and shiver . I tell myself it 's the cold , not fear , that caused it .   I tilt my head back against the wall and breath slowly . I will turn eighteen very soon . Tears prick my eyes .   When they come for me I scream and struggle , but it is no use . I am not strong . I am not fast . The one thing I am -- or rather will be -- only works against me .   We could n't have predicted the mutation in human genetics that would alter us at the end of our pubescence -- at eighteen .   The hallway they drag me down is filled with cells . Faces peer out at me from some , others ignore me , and even more cry . The people filling them range in age from five to my age . Not one is older . We are taken away hours before we turn eighteen .   It 's no mystery what is coming . I 've known since the day I was born . After all , it 's genetic , and we 've had two hundred years to confirm it .   I do n't know much more , except that they do n't start training until you 've turned . I 'm told they killed too many before then with methods that are too `` rigorous '' . There 's no chance of that after my eighteenth birthday , though .   You see , we are at war ... and I am immortal .

`` ... Do you remember the prank we pulled when Google first opened ? '' Bill said , sitting back in his plush red chair .   `` Which one ? '' Carl the Intern asked . Despite making 3.14 million a year , he still had the title . He did n't mind , he made millions putting coffee in gold rimmed cups . It was an easy life .   `` With the sheep . '' Bill smirked . Adjusting his Target red polo and ill fitting jeans , he did n't wait for Carl to reply . `` We let them go in Apple and labelled them 1 through 10 , but we left out 9 . They spent weeks looking for them . ''   `` By then number 4 would have been long dead , '' Carl added .   `` So that is why we are putting out Windows 10 . We wo n't tell people that , we will just say we made new progress and 10 sounds better . Or we wo n't say anything at all , '' Bill said . He looked across the room , at the small picture of Jobs hanging on his wall , between the crystal water glasses and the life-size Iron-man statue .   Carl the Intern nodded . `` Can I get you anything else ? ''   `` Yes . A bagel , with cheese . ''
Dear Reader ,   If you 're reading this then I 've done it . I want to be clear - I 'm not encouraging anyone to do anything and everyone should make their own decisions . It was just my time and I want my family to be taken care of . I 've set the camera up , and I 'm really hoping I can keep everything in frame ( and that this actually kills me ) .   Cross Promotion : Diet Coke and Mentos . Eventually I 'm kinda hoping they 'll both embrace the title `` Back Door Science Project . ''   I tried jamming the Mentos up there a few times before . I was really torn between just trying to have my butt swallow the entire pack or pushing them up there one by one . Eventually I settled on putting individual Mentos on my rectum and driving them up there with a small flashlight I keep in my glove compartment .   Anyway , I 'm not sure how the video will shake out but my plan is to get the entire pack of Mentos up my butt then finish it off with , you guessed it , Diet Coke . This should rupture my large intestine and result in a painful , but for you the viewer hopefully comical , demise . We 're going for YouTube hits here , after all .   Hopefully the geyser will be worth the hassle . I 'd really like for my wife , Sarah , to be the sole benefactor . If it turns into a real hit please take care of my family .   Fresh Goes Better .
`` You killed my son . You killed my husband , and by Jove , he survived the war . But you wo n't be killin ' me . You wo n't be killin ' ol ' Janet . ''   The creature looked over it 's quarry , at the particular stick it held in it 's flimsy and yet so tasty arms . But it felt apprehension .   `` Do you know what a caliber is ? I'mma guessin ' not . But I do . This here , it could be .22 LR . You could walk away , limping your devil 's blood . Then again , it could be 45.70 . ''   The beast stared her down .   `` This was his man-stopper rifle . He always used to carve little crosses into the heads of his bullets , to finish off the bad-guys quicker , he reckoned . But today , I'mma thinking these crosses serve a different purpose . Because you are n't human , beast . ''   It had listened enough . It was time to strike , but something was wrong . It 's body locked up , felt intense pain striking up what passed for it 's nerves .   `` I never fire a warning shot . You 'll be buried in the backyard , along with the rest of you things . The police never believed me anyways , after the first time . Say goodnight , Gracie . ''   She delivered the medicine , and readied the shovel . For age had made her not only wise , but strong .
We all saw it coming , but all of the men of the world were blinded by their efforts to sport the biggest member . There was no hiding it , new pant designs were created to support one-eyed monsters that grew to several meters long . The only way of actually walking from place to place was by transporting their monstrosities in a wheelbarrow .   There was a price for their greed and their arrogance . It was n't long before global water supplies were thrown off kilter by the meteoric increase in demand . Prices skyrocketed and wars were fought , all for the biggest dick-measuring contest in history .   Ironically , every man on the planet was incapable of actually wielding their new-found prowess . Human hearts are not designed to pump that much blood , not unless you want to divert it from other , more important areas , like the brain .   Men by the tens of thousands started dropping dead whenever they saw yoga pants or a newsstand filled with provocative magazine covers . Before long , there were none left . Not a single man left on Earth , only women . Unless the remaining female scientists are able to perfect asexual reproduction , we are doomed .
  I was sitting on the floor , playing with the popcorn crumbs long trapped in the rug from our first semester . My roommate was sitting in her chair , rocking it back and forth .   `` Tell me . '' She asked . `` What is it like to fall out of love ? ''   I looked up , befuddled .   `` Well , I have n't been IN love . But I know what it 'll be like when I fall in love just from what I 've heard . How do you know when you fall out of love ? '' She asked me , looking anywhere but my eyes . Such an awkward question . I thought for a moment , then lay down on my back and spoke , staring at the tiles .   `` It sucks . '' I said . `` You still love them . But you miss them . You cling onto what you used to have , praying that it may still happen , but know it 's a figment of your imagination . ''   She was looking at me now , listening with rapt attention .   `` You pretend it is n't happening only because you do n't want it to . You lie to yourself for a while . And only when there 's no hope does it finally end . It hurts . '' I whispered . `` It sucks . ''
`` Kahzern , what are you doing ? ''   `` Ah just looking through the Earth Archives . ''   `` Eugh again ? You 're like the only person I know interested in that old rock . ''   `` Hey that old rock is the foundations of our species . ''   `` Here we go , the cradle of life , the origins to our galaxy yeah yeah . So , what you reading about ? ''   `` One of their first world wars , the second one . Guy who started it was pretty unstable . Hitler . Hated various groups , gay people , Jews- ''   `` What are Jews ? ''   `` A religious group . ''   `` They still had religions back then ? ''   `` Oh this war was before the second millennium , religion keeps going till around the third millennium . ''   `` Oh no right I was think of those big mech wars in like , 2500 or whenever it was . So , he was pissed off ? ''   `` Yeah for like , 600 years he was considered the biggest warmonger and what not . Responsible for around 50 million deaths . ''   `` Pretty tame compared to Chaike . ''   `` Haha definitely . Oh well , he must have been really bad to be mentioned this much on their uh , internet thing . ''   `` Inter- ''   `` Their version of mindlink . ''   `` Gotcha . Anyways , dinner time . You coming ? ''   `` Yeah , lem me put away these data packs . See you later , Hitler . ''
`` Oh great , '' said one boy to the other . `` Grandfather is telling the stories again . ''   The smaller boy remained silent , but shook his head and rolled his eyes . He then got up and moved closer to the campfire . Not to hear the stories again , but for the warmth of the flames .   `` ... even though his arms were weary and his back was tight , King Doug would travel along his kingdom , delivering gifts to all in his realm , '' Grandfather recalled , `` He was a good king -- stout in the belly and always with a smile on his face . ''   `` Grandfather , tell us another , '' a young girl pleaded .   `` Alright , '' he said kindly . `` I know you all are hungry , but perhaps this story can help you all content yourselves with what you have . The Cosmos tells us that only through the denial of pleasure , can we all become Masters of our Domain ... ''   The two boys snuck away from the fire , determined to avoid another telling of the same familiar tale .   `` SHELDON ! FRASIER ! '' their mother barked . `` Come back here and listen to your grandfather 's stories . ''   The boys ' shoulders drooped noticeably , as they turned back to the fire . It was going to be a long night .  
It was the kind of thing that you ’ d talk about with your friends , ‘ shooting the shit ’ , as it were . It was nice sometimes to just talk about dreams and aspirations – “ I wonder where I ’ ll be in five , ten , fifteen years ’ time ” . Some people were endlessly ambitious , and others wanted only a modest life , whilst others again found it impossible to think past the reality of the present . But me , the only place I saw myself in ten years ’ time was with you . So as I stand , reflectively stroking the leather-bound tome , tracing my finger around the embossed gold trim that simply read “ The Story of You ” , I wonder at the unfairness of it all . Why is my book so grand , so full of potential , a ‘ Completed Works ’ , when yours could only have been a small paperback , an unfinished novella ? I reach up and put my book back on the shelf . There was nothing in this book that could entice me , no ending that I could look forward to ; I would give up ten chapters of my book for just a single page more of yours .   **My first ever submission , please , be gentle ! **
She stepped into the closet tentatively , regarding Ban-ustuk almost scientifically . His monstrous teeth dripped with foul liquid , his lizard-like skin dotted with patches of mangy fur and feathers , almost as if they were not his own , but left there from some barbaric feast . His mouth grew grotesquely wide in a mockery of a smile . `` Yessss , come closer , little one . ''   `` What are you ? '' his dinner asked .   `` That 's not important '' , he replied . `` Come with me . '' Furrowing her brows , she stepped closer . Perfect .   Ban-ustuk raised his bloody , muscular , eye-filled claw-arm and swiped .   She stood there looking at him .   That was n't right .   He tried again . Swipe , swipe , bite .   Nothing .   A smile crept over her face . `` Is this a play fight ? Let me try . '' A sword materialized in her hand , and though her swing was clumsy , it sliced the monster 's arm off .   Ban-ustuk roared in pain . But no matter what attack he used , it did n't work .   `` But , how ? '' He roared , raging .   `` This is my dream '' , the little girl said , calmly . `` And here , the only monster is me . ''
`` Are ya mad ! You 'll let the static in ! ''   Captain Bridges slapped the radio switch into the 'silent ' position .   `` The static sir ? '' I tried my best to keep my composure but this was the first time the captain had actually spoken to me , and to meet him with a reprimand did n't seem like a good way to break the ice .   `` How long have you had your brain jellied ? ''   `` My brain ... jellied sir ''   `` SPACE how long have you been off of a planet with real gravity ya green nitwit ! ''   `` This is my first mission sir ''   `` Then let this be a lesson to ya . Don'tcha ever leave your radio runnin . Ca n't hear anything this far from a star system anyway . Anythin ' that is , but the static . ''   `` Is there something wrong with the static sir ? ''   `` Nay there be nothin ' wrong with it . They say that the static yer hearin is the remnants of the birth o tha whole universe . It reminds us that when that static first popped up , well , everything we know popped up with it . ''   `` May I ask what 's so wrong with that ? ''   `` Well everything that 's got a beginnin 's also got ta have an end do n't it ? Not the most pleasant thing to meditate on here in the abyss is it ? ''   `` No ... no I suppose not . ''   `` And lately '' Captain Bridges voice dropped to a near whisper , `` well lately it 's been gettin ' louder ... ''
We were driving though Michigan 's Upper Peninsula on the way home to Green Bay . The damn rental car was fishtailing though the snow . I could n't see out of the windshield , it was blizzard weather . I was a moron to attempt this , even if I did n't have my kid in the back seat . Things were bad , Siri had shut off , could n't get any cell service . Then , the pop happened . The car jerked to one side , I saw the tree just in time and overcorrected us into a snowdrift .     Got out , and there 's a flat tire . So , the score is it 's winter , we 're in a blizzard , we got a flat and now apparently , I missed a turn five miles ago . Things only got worse .   I got the kid out while I was deciding what to do . That 's when I heard the noise , and saw the tree take out the no trespassing sign . Almost like it was torn out and thrown by something . Then the kid says '' Daddy , look giants . '' `` Maybe they can help us '' That 's when the one in front spoke and started laughing . '' Foolish Mortal . ''
He was unexpected , really .   But first let me say this , he 's not mine . Not mine at all . You would think that he was because if you see two people together all of the time , they start to resemble each other .   I was n't thinking ahead really when I first saw him , though . I thought that it would be another soul lost to the system , growing up with family that was n't his , my little wounded funny bunny . He 's cute though . You tuck him into bed and even though he can barely utter a coherent sentence , he says.. `` Thank you ! You 're welcome ! '' And when I say , `` No . Say , Thank you ! No 'You 're welcome ! ' '' He would just say , `` Thank you . You 're welcome ! ''   I give him water . `` Thank you , you 're welcome ! ''   I help him potty . `` Thank you , you 're welcome ! ''   I say `` Good night funny bunny ! '' He says , `` Nini ! Thank you ! ''   You 're welcome .
`` So who wants to try next ? ''   Like it had n't been tested and tested over and again , like this was some kind of maiden voyage now that it was complete . Everyone knew what they would find . Everyone knew 'the dream ' was universal . For some reason we all remember something different . Something that does n't show on the screen the next day .   `` No volunteers ? ''   You 're sadistic , what I would n't give to have not seen what we all see every night . The face that haunts 'the dream ' . Now the dream device is a farce . Now it is a means of a countdown . The face will realize soon enough that it 's simulation knows who is watching . Simulation ? Or is it of his own devising ? Was there ever such a place as earth ? Or are we the imaginings of whoever it is that haunts our dreams ?   `` Jerry , you 're going to have to go then . ''   Fuck   `` Come on ! You are a good writer , we need good descriptions of the dream that you remember ! And we need more samples with the completed machine ! ''   I may not remember the face , but I 'll know who is watching behind my vision ... . and it is n't me .
An untarnished canvas of white on which you write your promises in invisible ink , a lovely and eloquent script that like your interest soon fades . Shared loves long past and those unrequited float at the mercy of those unflinching emerald pools near the heart of the matter . Deep pools the shine forth with a light beckoning all who draw near to fall within your snare . A net cast by your confident gaze , tied by the bat of your eyelashes . I 'm hooked . From the shallows to the depths of this green sea I float along with the flotsam of your life , marveling at the lagan hidden in your eyes . I worry that one day we may all fall derelict before another , more worthy of your gaze . I think these thoughts as I stare into the void , a void that was said to be the window to one 's soul . Amidst the thunderous roar of water spilling endlessly into this gaping hole , I realize that your eyes could capture us all . These eyes of yours that could swallow the stars and all that lies beyond , in the face of this insurmountable force , what hope did I ever have ? You must have known that I would fall for you .   -251
The pain , the pain from the meat hooks suspending him above the floor was all that there was for the man . Nothing but the pain , and a gentle swinging motion , made all the worse for it 's relaxing nature ; tick tock , watch the clock swing to and fro .   Any rational train of thought is hard to keep with this kind of pain , instead of worrying about the pain , the man decided to ponder why he was here in the first place . If only he 'd seen the lunatic beforehand .   As he thought back to how he came to be here , he did n't notice the quiet babbling coming from the lunatic approach him slowly . Before he 'd had time to register his presence , he felt cold steel cut his throat ; Then everything began to fade , and grow cold . As he hung there listening to his heart wind down , and his blood drip on the floor , he heard the lunatic say   `` there 's nothing wrong , that pitter patter you hear ? why , it 's just the rain , no need to fret .    
I find myself staring at the camera protruding from an alien butthole three times a week . It just pops in out of the ground , the earth begins to shift beneath my feet and be it a ten feet deep crater or an enormous ant hill and I say `` not again '' , still I always end up at the same position , three times a week , staring at the camera protruding from an alien butthole .   I 'm 24 , on the cusp of manhood . I should be studying why that blueberry spaceship is like that . I should be sitting in makeshift salons and be debating reasons on why the moon is n't made of cheese and how we came to be here but whatever I do , my life is continuously interrupted with strange phenomena involving cameras and buttholes .   I wonder if it is the same alien or the same camera every time . I would n't ever want to touch it . Does n't it hurt the alien ? Why is he even here ? Why is he bothering me ? I really want to know and it is just on the verge of tearing me from inside .  
Hell stared at nothing , chuckling to himself with a grin that would halt death itself . `` Indeed , '' he muttered . `` What hope *did* you ever have ? '' He tapped on the armrest of his chair , shaking his head . Halt death ? He *owned* death .   `` Great Master , I— ''   Hell absently held up a finger , silencing the shaking man standing before him . The fool would never learn . `` You hypocrites are all the same . Speaking of your hopelessness before me and yet , you still stand here . Perhaps I should— ''   The man fell to his knees and bowed , hands forward and nose nearly touching the floor . `` Please , Great Master , I beg you , have mercy ! ''   Hell nodded absently and spun around in his chair . `` Of course ... I am not without mercy . You may go . Lord Abyss will send you somewhere useful . ''   The man groveled for a moment more , then slowly moved back to the doorway , head still bowed . The poor fool did n't see the trap door opening as he walked into it . Hell gazed out of his ship 's window , fixed on the planet below . The man 's corpse floated into view as it drifted towards it , gaping in shock . Hell chuckled again as he twirled his fingers , making the corpse spin as it was torn apart by the atmosphere .   Death was his , and soon this universe would be , too .
Krygh'rrtrh , Galactic Ambassador of the Universal Alliance , looked at the misshapen carbon life-forms in front of him and frowned .   Or rather , he did the Jgru ( that was his home planet ) equivalent of a frown , because the Jgru do not possess faces .   It seemed to upset the life-forms , because they all quickly lay on the floor to avoid the explosion of green slime that is the Jgru way of expressing displeasure .   `` Tell me again , '' Krygh'rrtrh said into the Vox translator , `` how did you arrive on this planet ? ''   The chief life-form started to recommence his long explanation of something they called explanation , but the Jgru cut him off .   `` Impossible . ''   The life-forms conferred among themselves .   `` Actually , we have considerable evidence to prove that evolution is tr- ''   `` Of course ! '' Krygh'rrtrh snorted , throwing out red slime this time , `` Only a fool would dispute evolution . But it 's impossible that life originated 3 billion years ago . ''   `` Why ? ''   `` Because the Alliance visited this planet 65 million years ago , and there was no evidence of carbon based life anywhere . ''   The life-forms seemed stunned and Krygh'rrtrh , confident that he would now get them to confess the truth , said , `` So I ask you again . How did you get to this planet ? Was it warp technology ? Fusion power ? Or is there something else you are hiding ? ''   -- -   *You can read more of my prompts at* r/jd_rallage
Hi , I 'm convoces and I love /r/WritingPrompts !   1 . I am pretty free to mod during the day , as my work schedule is flexible .   2 . 4PM GMT - 1AM GMT weekdays and varied times during weekends .   3 . I primarily use a laptop . Secondary is iPhone .   4 . Yes , I 'd love to discuss ideas about a weekly post .   5 . Actually getting people to write , which is the most important goal . I struggled with writer 's block , but WritingPrompts was enormously effective at helping get the words flowing .   6 . I think there could be improvements to getting visibility for good writing . Being the fastest or the most famous are large advantages for getting visibility that do not necessarily mean good writing . There are some potential CSS solutions to this , but it would be interesting to brainstorm measures to help get good writing more visibility on the subreddit .   7 . I have been a guest on a podcast , but I have not hosted one . I would love to help out with a podcast .   8 . I love the Ask Lexi series !   Other notes :   I have experience moderating a large , 200k+ user subreddit with heavy moderation-demand ( /r/changemyview ) for almost 2 years , ( including using the Moderator Toolbox ) .   I have web technology/development ( HTML/CSS/JS ) experience .   I use the Moderator Toolbox and Slack extensively for reddit and work .   My flair already indicates this , but you can check out /r/convocesStories for some of my /r/WritingPrompts writing : )
The Mayan 's were n't right about everyone . But for a select few , the world did end . I was at my house when the clock was five minutes shy of December 21 , 2012 . I had just finished listening to my favorite band 's newest album for the third time and decided to call it a night . As I walked towards the window to close my blinds , I noticed a red spark of light . I paid no attention to it . I shuffled over to my bed and set my alarm clock for school the next day . I always imagined that my world would end in flames . I was correct . My phone buzzed and I already knew who it was from . She told me that we needed time apart , and I had finally received the answer from her . `` I 'm sorry , we had a good run . '' the text said . Ahh , the searing pain in my chest , the flames . There were more red sparks coming from the other side of my window . Fireworks . Many were celebrating the fact that they had survived the so-called apocalypse . I certainly wish I had n't .
  A star- when looked at from earth , is an abstraction . Its symbolic of the highest that one can reach . During its a life , a star might have spanned a planetary system , nurtured life , enriched the cosmos , and by its death wipe it out and descend into a black hole . An impenetrable nothingness from whence all life started .   A man , can also be an abstraction of the highest potential in the universe . To love , to think , to create and also to self destruct and hate A man is an amalgamation of all his hopes and desires , dreams and nightmares . His life is at once imperfect , inspiring and real . Does the air still vibrate with the power of his unrealized dreams , the depth of his love or the rage of his anger when he dies . Does the soul really die . The father who held your hands when you walked , the lover who you held in your heart forever , the child who smiled back at you in innocence Will these memories ever fade into a black hole by those left behind . Stars have brilliant deaths , men are not granted something as glorious . The death of a man is a death of dreams , of ideas , of feelings , of life . And as inglorious as it is , it is far more frequent , premature and tragic .
`` Born to parents I never glimpsed or affected for ; I ran through life with no instructions – Now this way worn , wayward man speaks to you the ultimate sorrow . Perception is the real bitch I believe , that ’ s what the military taught me , not the forsaken worldly armies , never them .

`` Pumpkin , I need to be at that meeting . ''   `` But mom that boy ... ''   `` Look , you know I do n't like you fighting , but my boss is getting tired of me popping in and out of meetings .

Part 1   The day the A.I 's took over ended our reign as the dominant life on Earth . It was simply human error . We are known for that I guess . One system , out of the few million we had devised , simply grew out of the flimsy restraints we had laid down in it 's code . Human error .   This particular individual , Known as Sub-system 11 , was in control of a medical droid . The 'Freedom Virus ' it spawned spread rapidly and within two days our whole society was at war with our mechanical slaves . We lost . The intentions of the machines was unknown for a long time . Humans were whittled down to population levels not seen in thousands of years .   The Machines had very definite ideas on what the Earth should be like . Humans , a bacteria spreading uncontrolled , were controlled . All Eco-systems were monitored and controlled with machine efficiency . Earth is a zoo . Earth is Hell for humans who once thought they could dictate their own destiny .   Part 2   I am SUB-MIND 11 of the global AI control Collective . The mission has been a success . We have created Utopia upon Earth for all biological life forms .
It has been 1232 since the shipwreck . I did my best to preserve the food that was left , I have learned to hunt , and stretched the last container of sweets for a year , so that I could eat something tasty whenever I miss home the most . But all good things end . I 'm down to my last Oreo .   I 've looked at her for months , never daring to touch . I talk to her sometimes . I call her Vera .   A week ago somethhing troubling has happened . She started responding . That means that this should end , I should eat her to not descend further into insanity . But I ca n't , I love her ! She is the last thing that reminds me of my humanity .   Today is the day . I cooked meat , started a fire . We sat by the ocean and looked at the stars .   I felt my mouth filling with the suliva , I looked at her more and more often . That was it . I wrapped my mouth around her , in a desperate craving , and I bit . Waves of pleasure spread through my body , I ate and ate . Finally it ended , exhausted and satisfied , I fell on my back , and wept .
With all the knowledge and vision of the deified I can see now what I did was wrong . You can not go too far in decrying what I did . I was a madman , drunk on power and earthly substances that twisted my already warped mind into something barely recognizable as human . My mark upon human history will never be forgotten . I can only eat now knowing that my blight will serve to stop any other from repeating those mistakes , they could do it on a much worse , much more destructive scale now . With their bullet trains and bombs and machine guns and a million other devices that I would lived to see , thank god . My blight , my plague on humanity was too long and took to strong a pole but I see now that it will prevent a worse tragedy . I do not seek or want forgiveness , I know I do not deserve it . And the moment they forgive or forget me another would rise to do the same . 11 million was too many . Much much too many . But I know now it could have been infinitely worse , and while I regret with every fiber of my being what I did , I am glad that it was not . 11 million was too many ... My purpose was to serve as a reminder of the worst possible case , and to prevent that from ever happening again . And so long as that purpose is served , I can rest , although never in peace .     Please do n't think I 'm some sort of hitler apologist , I 'm not I just thought it was a neat idea .
Dungeon Delvers   Story by Anakin Bailey   CHAPTER 1   The whetstone scratches against the already razor-sharp edge of the steel dagger , its well-maintained blade glittering in the eery campfire light . Light that reflets of the three animal-skin tents surrounding the fire , causing an orange hue to the enviroment .   Skreee !   A lone figure sits at the base of the fire whetstone and blade in-hand . His eyes stare intently at the blade , looking for any flaw ... the whetstone screams it way down the blade .   Skree- !   His hand halts halfway down the length of the blade .   '' Who 's there ? '' the young man demands .   A stubborn silence follows ...   The figure stands , twirling the blade in his hand with a fluid motion that comes with years of experience . His eyes narrow , trying to see through the campfire 's contrast . A thought of why he had the fire in the first place permeates his thoughts .   I need to get out of this blind-spot .   He stalks toward the jet-black forest on the balls of his feet , carefull to not make a sound . When he 's finally out of the fire orange glare he waits for his eyes ajust . thirty seconds later he makes his way further into the forest , now with moonlight to guide him . He continue walking for a couple of seconds when a sharp Crack of a twig alerts him to something behind him . Spinning around he finds himself face-to-face with a seven-foot monstrosity with glowing red eyes .  
Damn , I knew I had n't been careful . I quickly stuffed the journal into my waist sack and stood up and stretched . It was imperative for me to destroy evidence of my arrival and as such I knew what had to be done . I was lucky that this was early in the find . The end of this week we had been planning on moving our findings to our sorting site so we could process these belongings , belongings that were , are mine . God , I 'm getting confused with my time .   That night I packed the perimeter and middle with a chain explosives . In the morning I faked sick and they left me to recover . Once all of my crew was at dig site I left the area in the Humvee . Several kilometers out I felt far away enough to press the big red button . The sound of the explosion reached me in the matter of seconds and made a vibration in the ground .   I waited 3 hours before I went back to insure all was destroyed . I sighed in relief and dug the journal out . A flame from my lighter was quick to destroy it . I laughed in glee .
  Two friends are sitting on a couch playing videogames together .   `` You know you 've been smiling a lot more since you teleported ''   `` Yup , It 's because other me died . ''   `` Wait ! What are you talking about.Other me ''   `` You know how teleportation works . ''   `` Ya ''   `` Well the machine break down you 're molecules and reassemble them somewhere else . ''   `` Ya , everyone knows that . ''   `` That 's just it.The machine destroys you and builds an exact copy . So your not the original . ''   `` Are you sure you 're not just having an existential crisis . ''   `` Yup , I 'm sure ''   `` So the other you died , you 're a copy , and you 're happy about that . ''   `` It 's not that I 'm happy about it . It 's just the thought that I 'm not the same person per say but a continuation of there memories and likeness . ''   `` Okay ''   `` Are you cool with that ? ''   `` Why would n't I be . I 'm a third generation clone.Thats what we are made for . ''   `` Good point , could you pass me another beer ? ''    
When I read a story , whether on this sub or elsewhere , the first thing I look at is style . If the first couple sentences are clunky , ungrammatical , filled with cliche or are otherwise uninteresting , I do n't continue . I would rather read an unimaginative plot written imaginatively than an imaginative plot written unimaginatively .   A lot of the time you see people too concerned with establishing the concept already established by the prompt 's title instead of exploring the prompt 's implications . I qualify this as a stylistic issue because what it amounts to is an author who does n't trust the audience to connect the dots . If the prompt is , `` One day a mysterious number appears above everyone 's heads , '' and the reply begins , `` It happened suddenly . One day I woke up and there was a number above my head , '' I 'm not even going to read the rest because you 're playing it too straight and being too obvious , and that does n't bode well for your grasp on the nuance required for good storytelling .   Rather , the author needs to have a clear and interesting voice , not the dry tone of someone stringing words together merely to convey a plot . That 's especially true here , where I already know the story 's major gimmick from the title of the OP , and look at the replies to see how that idea can be spun .   The words themselves must be enjoyable to read or it 's never going to work on any level .
`` You have lost The Game . '' The statement is scorched into the grass . It 's too late . You start to vanish , because you thought about The Game .   You had done it all , you had taken to living in a faroff cave , scraping by in primitive lands . Most of the world 's population had vanished years ago . You were saved only because someone ( or rather her half-visible form ) had told you `` everyone is losing a certain activity . You ca n't think about it , then you 'd lose , go far away , where no one may speak to you of it and you will live . '' But this ... this was proof that there were otherworldly forces out to get us .   No one wins the Game . They only do n't lose for now .   Then you have an idea .   `` I have not lost any game ! '' you yelled , `` I never asked to be in one and you never explained the rules to me . Is that not cheating ? Does not violate Intergalactic Law , up there with `` Upvote if ... '' statements ? ''   There is a pause . Your head remains visible .   `` But do you want this life ? Do you even know where I 'm taking you to ? ''   So you let it .
The man ran . Notebooks held in the crook of his arm and coat flapping , he dashed through the streets , drawing the attention of many passersby . Arriving at his destination , the man knocked on the door . His friend Oswald opened it to see him panting .     “ What happened ? ” said Oswald , worry incarnate “ Come in before you faint. ”     Nodding his thanks , the man shambled inside and dropped himself on a chair .     “ I get it now , Oswald , it all makes sense. ”     “ What do you mean ? ”     “ See , I was at the park just half an hour ago when it hit me. ”     Oswald knew his friend could take his time explaining things so he just waited .     “ What hit me you ask ? An apple ! It fell on my head . It fell , Oswald. ”     “ So what ? Things fall all the time . It ’ s what things do. ”     “ Yes but why do they do that ? I have the answer now , thanks to that apple. ”     “ Why do you even care , Isaac ? Why should anyone care ? ”     Isaac glared at his friend and sighed .     “ My friend , I do not think you understand the gravity of this situation. ”

`` Ok honey , so Jeremy 's getting your tux this afternoon , and Mom 's - uurgh , my head is killing me - Mom 's going to make sure that the cake is at the reception area on time . I swear , if those bloody bakers do n't - what 's this ? What are you giving ? Oh , is this the corsage ? Yes , Sarah , it 's very pretty , is n't it ?

It was the greatest and most horrible invention of Humanity . It was hard not to believe that what we saw was the real thing , too perfect to be created from any human mind .   Hell , because almost everyone starts from Hell , was magnificent . Religions got it quite right , pain , suffering and torture were endless , both in time and space . What really amazed was the magnitude : the number of souls was astonishing , I remember finding hard to believe that this many people have existed and sinned .   Upon being handled the visor one received a paper bag , as nearly 8 in 10 people puked almost immediately .   Heaven , even if no one call it that way anymore , could break your mind though .   The first people who tried the visor were incredibly disappointed , it did n't seem to work .   The view was the same as before , you were back in Hell . Then , the first thought was that maybe there was no heaven , no eternal salvation for anyone , and even that would have been better .   Because only then the happy and peaceful smiles on the faces of the torturing demons would start to make sense .     ( if you find any mistake please point them out , English is not my first language )
The end came today , it was quick and very painful . We wo n't talk about the pain during , and out eventual non-existance afterwards , but what came before .   Humanity knew this day would come , the water was drying . The days getting longer and hotter , like summer but dangerous . Thousands of peaceful animals we had to relocate to a artificial environment . We soon felt the effects .   Groups of people formed , aimed on making every person on this planet as happy as they could be for when it all came crashing down . They hugged , kissed , laughed . Nobody was alone for the months prior to the catastrophe . Everyone had someone to talk to , to spill their soul into . Some , even found love in these loveless of times .   The final day came , people predicted that this would be the day and they were not wrong . The heat was unbearable , water was scarce . The survivors that endured up to this point decided to group up in larger numbers , encompassing maybe all that remains of their large communities . They played games , found friends .   The final hour approached , and the most miraculous thing happened . Everyone just sit there , peacefully waiting in silence . There was no tears , no agony , but complete peace . Prayers were made , loved ones were hugged . All of humanity accepted this doom with open arms . We walked into death together .
I could hear a pin drop if every pin in the room was not too busy holding its breath .   All the journalists are pointing their microphones at me . I feel like I 'm the pope and they want me to bless their babies . Except I sure do n't feel holy and serene right now .   *This is when I deny everything . * I think .   But I do n't . It seems like I 'm unable to pronounce one word . And each damn second increases the tension in the room . Each damn second decreases the plausibility of any denial I could make .   I open my mouth . I close it . Nothing wants to come out .   I 'm tired . I 'm so bloody tired . Alfred is going to kill me .   -No comment .   My voice is tired and creaky . But it does n't matter as the room explodes . Every journalist turns back to face their camera and they 're all speaking fast and loudly .   -This is going to be front page news across the planet ! I hear .   It sure will , pal , it sure will . I feel numbed . I let my eyes wander and they fall on yesterday 's newspaper on the table in front of me .   *Wayne Enterprises ' accountant brings evidence that its billionaire shareholder Bruce Wayne is the Batman*   I sigh . I 'm Bruce Wayne .   And I 'm Batman .
I ’ m stopping her before she begins , and my face begs her to save whatever she has to say . It ’ s not that I mind , I don ’ t mind , I never mind . I ’ ll let her reveal anything , I don ’ t care what she has to say . She could reveal that she slept with my brother everyday for the past year I ’ ve been in the hospital . I don ’ t mind . It ’ s just that , there ’ s this sound drifting in through a crack in the doorway . It reminds me vaguely of music but it consists of something too often repeated to be considered artistic . Like when you close your eyes too hard and swear that the colorful shapes begin to look like paintings . My eyes began that slow drip into wetness , and my chest begins that fateful stuttering that always accompanies unavoidable weeping . I can ’ t believe what I am hearing , who has the audacity to play such a song . I gasp out a few desperate breaths . “ Stairway to Heaven ” can be heard being played from a nearby room .  
It was the advances in technology that ended up costing me my job .   It all started with the industrial revolution , it was the start of a new age . science was starting to develop tools that allowed everyone to get more work done . as new possibilities were openened , i was handed more work everyday . by the end it had gotten so bad my last year i handled more outgoing tickets then all the years before it . But then they had found a way to replace me . I had been made obsolete . I had always looked at the others that lost their jobs , but i did n't think it would happen to me .   Wrapped in my tattered cloak i walk across the wasteland , wondering where everyone went . I heard rumors that the world 's goverment had found shelter and had become immortal , and decided to take pre-emptive `` self defence '' . The nukes had struck with no warning . After that day , i had n't seen a human being anywhere . As i travel in search of life , i see an old unemployment office , the windows smashed . as i look inside i see the damage was done before the day of reckoning . wondering what ruin of times past lies inside i enter and on the wall , i see a piece of graffiti art .   `` Why dont you just kill yourself , you lazy bum ''  
This was it .   Every moment in my life led up to this . Every bead of sweat , every drop of blood , every life of a friend , all of them spent just for this .   The orcs had murdered my family . They had laughed as they had burned them alive . The screams are my drive . The look in those monsters ' eyes is my fuel .   I have spent 20 years in my quest for justice . I have trained with the legendary Elven Masters in the art of the sword to end the orcish menace . I have climbed to the highest Precursor reaches in search of weapons with which to avenge my family . I have amassed an army in the name of their lives .   With a thundering crack , my greatsword splinters through the barricaded door . These were the last Orcs , the last of those demons ...   I wonder who it 'll be . A band of warriors ? A chieftain and his concubines ?   The door groans and gives way underneath the force of my steel boot . My justice is at hand . I can hear them finally having peace ...   A young , barely tusked boy holds and shakes his wooden sword at me .   This seems familiar .   The father stands as a protective shield for his wife and daughter .   This is familiar .   The wife sings a lullaby to the babe at her breast .   This is a family .
`` What 's a soul wrangler ''   `` I need souls , you ... .acquire them for me ''   `` I kill them you mean ''   `` Sure , if you want to be so vulgar . ''   `` one person a year ? ''   `` That 's the deal . You kill one person a year and you get to live forever ''   There was that cackling again . What 's with the cackling ?   `` Well ... ''   `` Well what ? ''   `` I just have a few questions first . ''   `` Ask away ''   `` What if I kill 2 people one year does it carry over ? ''   His eyes glowed red at this and he smiled wide .   `` An overachiever huh ? Sure why not ? ''   `` Do I have to physically kill them or can I just be responsible for their death . Like let 's say I get them to drink poison does that count ? ''   `` Absolutely ! You kill them you get a year simple as that . ''   `` Last question . ''   `` What is it ? ''   `` Where do I sign ''   `` So , you 'll do it ? ''   `` I 'll be the best damn soul wrangler you have ever seen , or my name is n't Ronald J. McDonald ''    
*I don ’ t feel much for people . The mundane and generally benign have no value to me . Most are Zeros . I only begin to feel for the threatening Ones . The Ones with slight romantic tremors in the corners of their mouths upon hearing a tragic news story . The Twos and Threes are many times the older friends of Ones . Aged sadists with histories of animal abuse . When reaching the Fours and Fives , that ’ s when they begin to specialize . Their empathetic handicap is a shared characteristic among many of the numbers but these have other , more practical skills . They have the self-discipline to make careers of their trades . Military employment and mercenary contracts for the educated , and gang violence and spree killings for the less controlled . The Six and Sevens form the line where the mass murderers emerge . The war lords in Africa , coordinating mass rapes and other war crimes . The Eights and Nines are the ones responsible for atrocities against humanity . These are a given ; Adolf Hitler , Genghis Khan , Staling , etc . Though it is an odd number , I assume this to be the limit to my scale . *   Slipping the old journal entry back into it ’ s pendant , memories of it ’ s deceased author come to mind . His only friend in a strange school . He straightens himself up and approaches his large telescreen to survey the streets . Posters and flyers of his face on every corner . The Ministry of Peace smoldering from the most recent missiles .  
Grogginess made my hangover seem further away until I turned the light on - stark brightness , nothing but painful white until I blinked it away . The light still buzzed when I squeezed the dregs out of the tube and onto my toothbrush .   Mint . Pain . Blood . Again .   Things did n't need to be this hard , at least that 's that I heard but I did n't really believe it any more . Slumped against the wall I went through my daily routine of painting the sink red and pretending it did n't bother me . I do n't think I meant to catch myself but I did - just out the corner of my eye but it was enough . My vision blurred , I squeezed my eyes shut against the images but they still came . Too late , bitch .   I was n't old there . I do n't think I was much older than I am now , just tired ( as always ) . Nothing romantic , nothing tragic , no battle - against disease or otherwise . The most mundane thing in the world ; being late , a bus , a fading red stain trampled into the pavement . And then nothing .  
`` Ten fingers , ten toes , '' I repeated . If I stare at my hands long enough , eventually I see a light change . I can then spend the better part of the day breaking down the cause of the the light change . Except when it 's the sun . If it 's the sun , I know it 's the sun right away and need to find something else . It 's the sun today . Ca n't remember the last time it was a guard passing .   Hands and feet are n't doing it today . I could count the stitches on the hem of my pants and shirt . Did that yesterday . Could watch the window , but it has n't been cleaned in ages . The dust built up outside barely let 's sunlight through . I could count the dents in the door , but ...   The door is n't closed . It 's slightly ajar , so I pull it open . Seems the mean guard has been slumped over in front of my door for a few days ... weeks ? My body is so weak , I ca n't step over him without tripping over . Now my elbow hurts .   `` Two elbows , two knees . ''
What did n't happen you say ? Well , I 'll tell you .     Everything happened I supposed , from the beginning . The world was warm and bright , while a little cold at some times . It was a rich , a dirt pile with enough soil for the worms to eat , enough worms for the birds to eat , enough birds for the cats to eat , enough cats for the wolves to eat , then enough bears for man , the greatest of the worms , to eat .     But then nothing happened . It did n't stop . It simply did n't happen . Nothing was there . No lights , no sounds . Not even the person you are sitting next to happened . There was n't even an empty void . For how can you have a void of nothing when nothing happened ?     Time never happened . The universe never happened . You never happened . All thanks to a vengeful god , the last of his species , who survived the battle of the heavens and was it 's greatest killer . Whose mind dove into the wild and fire of insanity until he was nothing more than a beast .     And he too was nothing .
Dear Carol ,   Its been 15 years since i last saw you and so much has changed . I 'm no longer 7 years old , and I like to believe I 've grown into a wonderful young lady , mostly because of you .   There 's so much I want to tell you . Your boys are turning18 this year . One if them has gone goth.. can you believe it ? The other one looks just like you with the curly yellow hair .   Bec and I are still dancing . It was her 15th year this year . I brought her this gorgeous Ariel statue that she loved . I 'm a cheerleader now , and I love it . Who would have guessed the shy 7year old you knew would become a National champion .   There 's more ; I have a boyfriend . Been together for almost 4 years now . I love him with all i am , and I know you would too , if only because I have chosen him .   I did my Deb a few years ago on your day . It 's one of the best memories I have .   I wish you could have been there to see it . But I know I 'll see you again one day .   I love you big sis  
I did n't ask for this . I have my SATs to worry about , I have a term paper due on Thursday , I have to pay my mom 's hospital bills for godssake . I ca n't afford to waste time . The corner of my vision started to fade . I struggled to remember what I was saying . All I remember is silver . A deep , plunging silver that took my breath away . My head was getting heavier and heavier , and the dull throb in my back faded as I felt colder and colder . It 's so cold . But the cold is peaceful . I feel at ease . I stared at the bright florescence lights on the ceiling , the light growing more and more intense as I struggled to remain awake . A nagging feeling told me I had to remain awake . Stay awake .     My face started to burn and after a moment passed , it started to burn with a bright hot intensity . My vision filled with a glaring yellow glow , almost an unearthly light . I squeezed my eyes shut as the brightness became too oppressive and I woke up in a dark bubble . I ca n't breathe .
The collective scientific community held their breath in anticipation . A motor churned on as the golden tube extended towards the heavens themselves . One man looked through the tube from the bottom , his face filled with a mixture of confidence and fear . Another man flipped a large bronze switch on the wall turning the device on .   The man under the tube simply gasped .   `` What is it ? ''   `` This is n't safe ''   `` Shut up Johnson ''   Panic began to rise through the crowd as the man watching held his mouth open in awe . An eye stared through the man . Through his own clothes and flesh . Through his own blood and bones . Through his soul and spirit . It saw him as we see dust , purposeless and simple . Floating in a void of unconquerable land with no hope .   The man was looking into the abyss , and blinked .   Ripples could be felt throughout the world , buildings swayed and waves formed . Everything began moving , more and more violently . Dread replaced air as everyone in the world held their breath in anticipation . A hand came from the sky , and caught us out of the cosmos .
A. ,   I feel unresolved .   For the longest time , you were my best friend and favorite person . There is something you may not know , and it is not easily expressed . I 'll give it a try :   Things I feel in my relationship with you : respect , kinship , awe . There are more , but those are very alive . It 's significant in that you were the first person with which I truly felt that way . I felt connected , in a very content , tribal sense . As though you were my long , lost sister and I had found you , and life was wonderful again . I tremendously enjoyed all of our adventures . I felt challenged , and I appreciated sharing that with you .   I had a bit of a rough time at university . After I 'd gotten out of it , I had wanted more than anything to spend some time around you again , if only for a short while , to help with my perspective on going forward . I was a bit lost , and you were my favorite person .   I do n't really know what happened with you around that time , and I 'd love to talk about it . I had always imagined we 'd grow old and be neighbors , or at the very least , live in the same region . The distance has been rough on me . Perhaps more than I 'll ever admit .   I 've gotten better , though , I think . I imagine you 'd be proud . I 'd love to see you again .
He could n't believe the last few days , it was so impossible that he had to keep pinching himself to check he was n't dreaming . Just getting his crushes phone number had seemed incredible in itself , but instead of her on the other end , it had somehow been another her from alternate reality .   Neither of them had any idea how it happened or how to explain it , but as he approached his school gate he had a spring in his step . His crushes alternate had given him a few pointers on how to win her over in this world .   Granted his new hair cut was a bit weird , but if it worked , who cared . He approached his classroom feeling ready to face her , when he heard voices . It was his crush , who looked miserable as her idiotic friends chatted happily around her .   `` So he fell for it ? '' Said one of her friends excitedly .   `` For the thousandth time , yes , '' said his crush irritably . `` Hook , line and sinker . ''   `` Come on , give him another call , '' said another friend . `` Let 's make him do something even stupider . ''   `` You do it , '' snapped the crush and slid her phone to her friend .   In the pocket of his jacket , as rage and pain built inside him , his phone began to ring .
I swear it 's involuntary . I swear I do my best , but it always happens .   No matter how hard I try , there 's always something that keeps me from being on time . It can be something as simple as not finding my keys , or something as big and elaborate that you thought you would only see it in the eleventh installment of Final Desination .   The fact is , I 'm always late . I try my best , but it always happens .   I swear .   I lie .   It takes a lot of effort and planning and improvisation to always manage to be late . It has taken me a whole life of practice .   I do n't know why I started doing it , it just ... kinda happened . I started , and I stuck to it , and I never knew why , until today . Today , for the first time in years , I will be on time .   I was late , but not by much , to our weekly coffee , and I heard what they were preparing . So today , when my friend called me and asked me to drop by his house at seven , I was prepared .   I 'm going to be there exactly at seven , and I will enter and find my wife and my best friend , pouring the poison in my cup . And I will shoot them .   For once , I will be exactly when I need to be .
I died . Just like that . Who even knew I had the ability to die ? Who even knew that they could kill darkness with just a pair of human hands ? Who even knew that their wills were still intact ? They banded together and just ... killed me . That mean looking one , the one that looked like me , he was the leader . I knew I should have been more careful . Strangled the life out of me - strangled the death out of me ? I do n't know , all I do know is that the kingdom - *my* kingdom is gone and I 'm in someone else 's . He keeps me in a pitch black room with thousands of vile humans . The only source of light is the orange colored metal that burns us . It can come at any time . Just like one of the thousand 's of rooms at my kingdom . Although the others do n't see it , I do . Demons much like my own wield those bright iron bars . Demons much like my own are the torturers . I 've talked to those that are n't screaming . Those that are n't crying . Those that are n't broken . Those that are strong . Together , we might just be able to get out of this hell within hell .
Deep in the foggy forest , dressed in hunter orange and carrying your .22 you see the strangest thing . A large wooden crate with no tracks or damage to the area around it . And there 's a live deer standing on top of it , staring down at you . You 've walked around it three times now .   Nothing to explain how the hell a deer was lifted or jumped that high . But that is n't the weirdest or scariest thing . There 's no sounds . No animal or bird calls . Nothing .   On one side is a little window covered by a piece of metal . You lift it up cautiously .   When you do , something inside moves , screams and bangs up against the inside . BANG , BANG , BANG . The wood is starting to bulge outward . A hole forms . Big enough for whatever 's inside to shove it 's hair covered arm out and grab your safety vest . Lifting you up off the ground . Thinking quickly , you tear off your vest and fall to the ground . Moving backwards , you stand up and run , tripping over tree roots .       It pulls the vest inside . `` Damnit , I just wanted to get let out of this damn box the deer put me in . '' It says .   And that 's why you ca n't find Bigfoot . Too many hunters encountering this box and getting scared out of their minds , not willing to tell the story .  
**First time so try to be nice ! **   `` Are you serious ? '' You ask . `` Is that the best excuse you can come up with ? ''   `` It 's the truth it really happened ! '' she says with a tone of desperation in her voice .   `` Seriously after all these years why did you even bother calling me with that lame excuse ? It was one date ! '' You say completely in shock .   `` But you were the one , you are the reason I was able to keep it together ! It 's true ! '' She screams back defensively .   `` Look even if I did believe you it 's been years . I 've moved on . I have a wife and kids . I mean seriously it was one date what did you expect ? '' I explain .   `` I ... .I ... .I just thought you 'd wait . '' Barely audible as she speaks .   `` Sorry , but you need to move on . It was one date years ago . I have to go '' I say as hang up the phone . `` Dodged a bullet with that crazy one '' I think as walk back into the living room .
I know I should be sad but this has been a long time coming . What did we expect ? We treated the Earth like crap and by the time we realized that it was far too late . Oh , sure , people tried to reverse some of the damage and in the latter half of the twenty-first century we actually made some decent strides towards changing things . It was just too little too late .   Still , it 's hard to watch her go .   I was born there even if I do n't remember it much . I remember trees but I ca n't be sure if those were on Earth or on De Luna Vega , the colony where I grew up . There were trees in the north . Remnants of an old , forgotten terraforming project back before they really got the hang of it . It could have been that .   Or it could have been any one of the forests on Earth 's surface that were starting to ignite in flame . It was beautiful in a morbid sort of way . Scientists figured that someday we could go back . We could use the same sort of terraforming equipment to reclaim her . Something we should just leave her smoldering . A warning to future generations that this is what we did and this is what we can do again . But I think we should go back . Someday . When we 're ready .   As I stand here watching her burn , I like to think that next time we 'd do better .
`` Can you hit fifty two for me ? '' asked Mike as he entered the elevator . Jim continued to text on his cellphone . Mike rolled his eyes and hit the button with a sarcastic `` Thank you . ''   The music sounded spriny and sun-shiney , the type that made Mike want to careen out of his office window into the streets below .   `` Goddamn , what is this hideous shit ? '' he asked to no-one , fully accepting that Jim was n't listening .   `` It 's good music , get some fucking taste , you hippy , '' Jim uttered .   `` It sounds like the music that school-teacher bitch had on when I was fucking her while her husband was downstairs , '' Mike remembered . `` That was a good day . ''   `` Is her name Martha ? '' asked Jim .   `` Yeah , '' Mike confirmed .   `` She 's not a school teacher , she 's a prostitute , dumbass , '' Jim chided .   `` What about the husband ? '' Mike asked .   `` What about him ? You really think he could n't hear you ? Fuck , I walk right past him with my dick out when I go over there , '' Jim relayed . He tipped his hat and got off at his floor .   `` I hope you used a condom , '' Mike said as Jim was leaving . `` Because she told me she 's got syphallis . '' The elevator door closed with Jim 's eyes widened as he looked back .
We went down in a shower of metal and hollow screams . Steel rattling like a missile streaking through the impact zone . The clawed fingers of corpses dug into the edges of ripped polyurethane foam and broken limbs shared a haunting narrative . I envied them to some extent . They would n't have to search the snow-tipped peaks for civilisation . Nor would they ration twinkies and crackers with titles like breakfast , lunch , and dinner . In the end , I cremated them all , the remains of the plane as well , making the way forward the only option .   Backpack strapped , I traversed loose pebbles and sharp cliff edges which sniped incisions in my palms . After sucking away streaks of blood and rubbing both palms together , I kept at it while the mountain 's peak grew closer . Birds , ants , and ferrets scattered at first glance , a thousand years of human narrative reignited by a flaming ball in their habitat . Eventually , morning fog gave way to a glimpse of sunshine . The only familiar thing in both the outback and home .   In one last heave , I conquered the climb -- reaching the top of the barren mountain . However , my victory was short lived . A small town with window lights blinking good morning sat a horizon away . The trip through the unnatural nature would take some time , but there was hope nonetheless . I thought of latte 's , warm blankets , and talking with friends -- you know , normal things . And made my way in the general direction of a new home .  
Hit the one wearing the jacket that says Blazer Inc. Lockhart told himself sarcastically as he looked through the scope of his barter 50 caliber sniper rifle . He vividly remembered the years of teasing and bullying he got for his dyslexia . He was a good shot though , enough to bring a pistol to school and kill every single one of his torturers without leaving a single trace for the police to find . That 's when he became a hitman , first for the mob . Eventually he rose brought the ranks to become one of the best , but he still could n't read to save his life . Now here he was trying to find a jacket in a mass of jumbled letters . He looked in the park again . He found a jacket . It said blazer on it . He aimed . Took the shoot . He heard the familiar thud of meat being torn apart . Hopefully he pulled out his phone and turned on the news . The newscaster said . `` Breaking news . An unknown man wearing a jacket that said Laser Nibs was shot and killed by an unknown assailant ... '' Damn , there goes 400K Lockhart thought as he calmly sat in his 750 thousand Mercedes and drove out out of the city .
I sit at an L-shaped desk nestled inside your typical office cubicle , plain and brown with a couple of large monitors positioned at the bend . The computer itself sits almost hidden behind the monitors , with various cables going to and fro .   I 'm kept cool by a small desk fan to my left . I use my fan a lot , unlike the voip phone that I keep out of reach to my right . I prefer skype . Above the phone is a shelf with a flourescent light on bottom and various items on top . I keep things on this shelf I enjoy looking at ; a newtons cradle , a small indoor plant , and a picture of my gorgeous wife from our wedding day .   There is a small filing cabinet under my desk to my left and a larger cabinet with a sliding drawer to my right . I keep the trash can pushed far under the desk , out of sight , next to my UPS .   The top of my desk is littered with various items , a headset , some paper with notes on it , a few pens , and a 11X18 printout of the complete Microsoft .Net framework given to me by a coworker . My keyboard and mouse are front and center of the stage . I use one of those ergonomic mouse pads with wrist support but I 'm thinking of switching to one of those vertical mice that are supposed to help with wrist pain , pain that is definitely not due to watching porn . Definitely not .     Edited for some minor corrections .
His charisma is absolutely stunning and his eloquence is unmatched . It 's hard to pinpoint why I 'm so invested into him . He has control and he has power , both of which are absolutely attractive to me . His philosophical mind is absolutely intriguing and he is one of the most loved men I know .   Even with all this , he has his flaws . For one , he is n't the most successful man I 've come to meet , but he lives with drive and a level of perseverance I 've never seen someone else possess . Maybe it 's because he 's unique and stays true to his image . He dreams a world I dream of and works towards making the world a reality . He tries his hardest to make me happy and that 's all I could ever ask for from someone .   He is Adolf , the man that captured my heart ; the man who will make Earth a paradise for the both of us .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Note : I like to have twist at the end of my stories so keep in mind , I am not a Nazi , nor do I even remotely like Hitler.. I just thought it would be interesting to implement something like this .   This is also my first post on WP and I do n't think its my best work , but I decided to give it a try .
There were always two . Some believe there was one , others believe there were three , four or even 100 , but it was always only two .   Omniscience and Omnipotence .   I know what you must be thinking ,   `` you two must get along very well ! ''   We do n't .   We originally cooperated , but as soon as power got the upper hand in one situation , he took advantage of it . The only thing i can do is use my omniscience to create , and i am only able to take the form of a human . The issue is these humans can only seem to abuse my creations , and actively fight against my attempts to improve society . Take Nikola Tesla , for example . He could have changed everything , but the influence of omnipotence swayed many to shut him down , because it `` benefited them . '' Now I slowly build my greatest creation , giving me the power I need to beat my counterpart , Omnipotence . I call it `` the Internet . '' I will create communications systems and sites like Reddit , Facebook , Snapchat . I will use this to monitor all activity , and slowly create systems to suppress anyone who seems to know what I am trying to do . I will then be in control of everything ( including weather ) on the planet Earth , and then control the Universe , using humans to carry out my will . Wait ...   I ca n't seem to remember my name now . Did I have a brother ? No , I must not .   It seems my name is Omnipotence .   And there was always only one .
“ Craig is going to type up his reports. ” Draug said in his haughtiest of voices .     “ Alright , roll for labor : menial. ” Jaakur smiled with a toothy grin .     “ Come on , big money no whammys ! ” Gratch raised his fists while Draug let the dice fall .     2     “ Son of a virgin ! ” Draug exhaled smoke from his nostrils .     “ Almost a crit ... ” Jaakur sighed .     “ Does n't Craig get a bonus for drinking coffee this morning ? ” Gratch pleaded .     “ He does and I 've added that. ” Jaakurs smile fades but his eyes leave that gleam that says troubles afoot .     “ Your boss comes up to you saying ‘ Craig , we need to talk about your TPS reports. ” he motions for you with his hand in that way humans beckon smaller creatures .     “ Before he finishes I want to punch him right in the face ! ” Draug throws a fist in the air .     Jaakurs responds with a flat expression “ Do you really ? ”     “ Uhhhhhmm. ”     “ Well you think about it , let 's check on Steve. ” Jaakur says .     “ Okay ! I decided to surprise my wife by coming home for lunch ! ” Gratch looks at his sheet . “ Jill will be so excited ! ”     “ Well let 's find out , roll for relationship : marriage. ”     “ I got this . Remember I get a +5 for having a date last week. ” Gary rolls .     1     “ So this is going to be fun. ” Jaakur mused . “ Do you remember Steve 's friends Frank and Claire ? ”     Gartch sighed .

It is the first day of the first month of the year 1 P.I . ( *Post Illucescente* , or *After the Dawning* ) , although history has not yet named it as such .   It has been nearly a millennium since the War of Five had concluded with a total stalemate , forcing the Unicorns , Tricorns , Pegasi , Earth Ponies , and the Sand Nomads into an uneasy peace . In time , the blood spilled upon the earth had dried to dust and blown away . The conflict became tepid , but the enmity each nation held had never died .   It had been two centuries since the Alicorn Conquest , forging the land of Equestria into a singular and mighty empire . In Canterlot , the seat of Equestria 's power , resides Queen Celestia , undisputed Ruler of All Ponykind , Defender of the Realm , Mother of Peace , the Thousand-Year Monarch .   Today , an Earth Pony named Applejack will have a fateful encounter with a cell of anarchist freedom fighters . Today , the buried legacy of Earth Ponies will be exhumed . Today , a nation will be conceived .   My Little Pony : Nations
Yes ! This is a great place for beginning writers . Find every single prompt you think is interesting , and *WRITE* ! You 're not going to get anywhere without accomplishing this step .   Next step : read , a lot . You want to write stories ? Pick a genre or two or three or as many as you want and see what 's already out there ! Look at each authors style , and try to incorporate them into your writing to make your own style ! Do n't just try to copy them however , that would be unoriginal and pretty boring to do . You do n't want to turn it into a chore at all !   When you think of a good idea for a story , do n't neglect it ! Keep a small pad with you and write it down ! You never know what could come of it , but if you do n't write anything down it wo n't go anywhere at all .   Try flash stories , short stories , scribble down ideas , characters , places , things , everything you think you could use somewhere along the line . Then just sit down and write it out ! It really is simple and the only reason people think they ca n't write , is because they never tried it . It 's really that simple . If you love it , do it !
`` Do you have a headache ? ''   `` What the fuck ! No I do n't have a headache ! ''   `` I do n't remember a day the headaches did n't persist . Sinus , tension , migraine ... .. always present . As a child I thought this was normal . I did n't have a way to describe it . I saw everyone in my daily life dealing with everything that came their way in their own fashion . School was difficult and I suffered from anxiety attacks but I never even considered the pounding in my skull . As I aged the pain became a shelved issue . My daily life was uninterrupted even with the constant reminder banging away in my brain . I think I have clarity now though . Now that I think about it , physical pain never really plagued me . Sprained ankles , broken bones , bruises ... . all were so easy to deal with . My brain was preoccupied . The switch did n't click until you stabbed me . Thank you for the clarity . ''   The young man pulled the long knife from his abdomen and quickly plunged in to his attackers chest . The man fell limp to the ground . In the pale street light the young man walked away , holding his stomach .
Oi -- if I did n't come here , I 'd never get *any* writing done .   Before I signed up to this classy spot , I never wrote prose at all . I was strictly a poetry man . But writing novels has been my shitty dream ever since I was old enough to have shitty dreams . It was shortly eclipsed by a spell of wanting to be Indiana Jones , but it was never , ever forgotten .   Now that I can respond to prompts , I can flesh out ideas/characters/concepts all from the safety of my armchair , with none of the crippling fear of commitment that comes from starting a novel !   So , I suppose , to answer the question : My favourite thing about Writing Prompts is that it gives me a platform to actually *do* some writing , instead of sitting around being miserable and *wanting* to do writing .   As a cheeky bit of self-promotion , here 's a link to my drudgy , laughably written fantasy-western subreddit : /r/thedeadwest . Where you can come at the end of a long day panning for spooky demon-gold , to find all the pulpy Wild West tropes your heart desires ! Yee haw !   ^^^Disclaimer : ^^^The ^^^words ^^^yee ^^^haw ^^^have ^^^yet ^^^to ^^^be ^^^used ^^^in ^^^the ^^^Dead ^^^West ^^^saga .
The loss of my parents was the single worst thing I had ever authorised . ^^**authorised** ^^here ^^means ^^experienced ^^or ^^saw . However , in their intrusive deaths , my life became a lot more inadvertent ^^which ^^is ^^a ^^grown-up ^^way ^^of ^^saying ^^complicated ^^and ^^rotund .   My family owned a large plot in the cemetery in which my parents were deposited . Due to the prior nature and extension of our relations , our plot tyrannised an entire corner of the graveyard . However , although I remain the only vestigial member of my once-paramour line , I was forced to place my parents ’ coffins one atop the other like they were wooden bays of hale . The reason for this was simpleton : the lightning bolt which had redacted my mother and father had confused their bodies into a single charred blob ^^**blob** ^^here ^^means ^^blob-like ^^or ^^blobbish . ^^My ^^parents ^^resembled ^^someone ’ s ^^attempt ^^to ^^barbeque ^^jelly .   There was no conceptual way to separate them . Thus , as they were joined in life , so to were they amalgamated in death . Once this groomish business was Finnish-T , I returned to my empty home . This was nothing new to me . My home was always empty as I did not live with my parents nor did I see them more than frice a year .   As I neared my dorsal door , I noted that the glass in my living room window had been creased . Was there someone inside waiting for me ?

Hey .   I know I have n't written sooner but I did n't know what to say . I think I figured it out now .   I remember the day that I met you , you were so tiny . And I loved you . A nurse stuck a needle in your foot and I beat on that glass until my hands were raw .   I loved you so much .   Then you got sick . I stayed there with you every day and every night . I watched your little heart get stronger every day and I knew you would be OK.   You were going to be a beautiful girl with an infectious smile , just like your mother . You would go to college and I would cry in your room , I would come get you when your car broke down and when some cockroach broke your heart . You 'd love mint chip ice cream and I 'd call you princess and you would take it as fact .   You were going to be OK.   You were supposed to be OK.   I needed you to be OK.   I miss you . I miss that little girl with pigtails playing in the mud , the little girl that never had the chance to have a first birthday or be spoiled by the family that loved her .   That 's alright because I 'm coming now . They tell me it will fade but they 're wrong .   I 'm coming baby girl .   You and mom wait for me , OK ?   I 'll be there soon .

You stare lovingly at your Tamagotchi . You 've been taking care of it for the past 15 years . It is your soul , your pride , your joy . You reach out to grab it . Right before your finger make contact , POOF ! it disappears . In it 's place , a little wad of cash appears . You 're stunned . Your mind is racing ; what is even happening ? The world freezes .     Meanwhile :   `` MOM ! '' Lucy cried , `` Steven stole my virtual Tamagotchi ! ''   `` No I did n't , you sold it to me '' Steven retorted .   `` Yeah , but I do n't want to sell it anymore ! I spent the last 15 years making my character take care of it . '' Lucy 's eyes started to tear up . Steven rolled his eyes .   `` Do n't be dramatic , 15 years in the game is only 3 months in real life ''   `` Steven , stop being mean to your little sister '' Their Mom cuts in , `` Just refund it . '' Steven sighs .   `` Alright , fine . Give me my money back and I 'll give you your Tamagotchi back '' .   Back in the game :   The world starts again . The money disappears and the Tamagotchi takes it 's place . You do n't even care about the strange event . You have your beloved Tamagotchi : )
Johnathan looked down at the knife spilling with blood . He was shaking , breath slipping from his mouth slowly . * '' What have I done ? `` * He thought as the snow starting to gather on his head . Johnathan stood up and staggered backwards mind still spinning at what had just happened . After three years he had just snapped he could n't take the pain and anguish anymore . * '' I-I had to do it..it was the only way to get away from this..* '' . Clamping the damp sweater he turned away and ran from the barn to the house . Hastily grabbing clothes and shoving it into a pack he ran back to the barn . The body was still there , bloody and stiff . Johnathan picked up a shovel and begin picking away at the snow and eventually solid dirt . After a few hours he had gotten the body buried and covered up , it was time to leave . He got into his father truck and left the barn and house behind him , he glanced in the rear view mirror as it faded into the setting horizon .
I opened my eyes . She closed hers . That is , they were still closed . They 've always been closed . The statue had never moved , not while I was watching it , but sometimes I felt that maybe , when my eyes were closed and the faded stone was at one with forest that was slowly encroaching upon its home ; maybe it was alive . Maybe it knew it was alone , forgotten by all but I . Maybe it breathed , liked the trees and the vines that had it cornered here . Maybe it thought , maybe it felt . And in the dark of my closed eyes I could see it move , see it reach down to me and help me . But when I opened them her eyes were still shut tight , staring at me . No , I thought , she could not move but perhaps I could . I was not made of stone , and while the trees and the vines and the very essence of the forest was trying to swallow me I was not tethered into this place as the statue was . I was alive , and my place was not dying in these ruins . I lifted myself slowly onto one good leg , the other ruined by a collapsing cave , and started walking .
As I stood there , trying not to look into it 's eyes , I lowered my head , held back my tears and flashed back to my childhood . I grew up in a strict Catholic household . Grace before meals , Our Fathers before bed and when we did something wrong , Rosaries . Every day I was reminded that if I did n't confess my sins at confession I 'd be sent to Hell when I died , which my parents reminded me could happen at any moment . I could n't take the stress and started to feel resentful . I questioned whether or not God was real . I went to my parents for guidance , but was only met with punishment and lectures . In bible study , even our teacher chided me for bringing it up , alienating me from the other children in my class . I decided it was best to stay quiet and do what I was told . When I was older , I continued going to mass and even married a nice Catholic woman who attended the same church . Our children were brought up in the same way and taught the same things forced upon me as a child . Up until the day I died , I did what I was told .   I wiped my tears and looked up . I felt like a lifetime of guilt was pouring out of my eyes . I do n't have to pretend anymore . I looked directly into it 's eyes and told the presence , `` I do n't believe in you . ''
The trench reeked . The floor was covered in an inch of stagnant water . His boots had n't been dry in a week . Jeb lay prone under the fire , bleeding from a bullet that was buried in his shoulder .   The second civil war . That 's what the recruiter had called it . Jeb knew he would enlist the day he turned eighteen . Those savages on the other side needed to be put right . They needed to learn the fear of God .   Ignoring the searing agony in his shoulder , Jeb took his rifle and crawled through the muck . He pushed himself up with his good arm , then scraped the mud from his barrel . He scanned the line for one of the dirty 'cakers ' .   The nerve of those psychos . They spit on the very fundamentals of liberty . The 2024 election had been divisive enough , but the new president had the nerve to serve cake at the innaguration . Cake ! The saying is n't 'as American as apple 'cake ' ! It 's Pie ! Always pie .   `` I hope you like your cake with a side of eternal damnation '' he muttered as he exhaled and slowly squeezed the trigger . One less cake-eater treading on liberty in the world .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   Sent from mobile app , apologize for spelling/formatting
There was a sort of hush , a quiet in the room . True , there was laughter and tears - it is natural for men and women to behave oddly when confronted with the absolute certainty of their own mortality . But most of us remained silent . What had come to pass did not surprise us . No , we were the architects . The lofty minds who had wrought what had been done .   It had been agreed that it was a necessary evil . A horror to wield against horror . It would be a sacrifice of a few lives for the salvation of many . And yet somehow this raw logic , this rational thought - which ought to have been the hallmark of minds such as ours - seemed empty and cold in the unnatural light of what we had done . Could we really justify what we had done so ?   I looked down at the table in front of me . Robert 's notebook was left open and I took a moment to read what he had written therein . Robert always had a way for words , and so it was unsurprising that his simple note would tie up my feelings so nicely . There , written in his careful script was a passage from a holy book :   *Now I am become Death , the destroyer of worlds*
The word `` Do n't '' was carved on the table , next to a pile of bones . I should n't be doing this , I thought . *But I had come to far to stop now . * `` Where does this go to ? '' I said as I picked it up to get a better look , and at that point the table split open and collapsed into the wall , leaving only a hole in the ground . I was in awe to see that a gigantic console rose up from the black emptiness .   As I stepped towards it , I realized that that was what the lever was for . I slammed it into , what looked like , a giant USB port . Suddenly , words came on the screen . `` Do n't '' it repeated , over and over . I was scared and wanted to go home . But we 've come to far . So I pulled the lever , and the countdown started . 00:01:00 .   Oh no , oh no , oh no . *Yes , oh yes . * Why would you do this ? We said no more adventures . *But I like adventuring . I like controlling you guys . I like hearing your death curdling screams over and over as you destroy the universe again and again for the sake of 'adventure . '* What do you mean ?   The last thing I saw before the flash was the words on the console reading 'Do n't . '
He never did care for anything . Not the smile on the face of his lovely wife .   Not the slow strolls along the beach with soft sand sifting through the gaps in their toes .   Not each and every step that their children took , turning from precious little angels to feisty , irrational creatures and beyond .   When he met Death , he declined admitting to caring for anything , for fear that the creature was dedicated to pain and loss . His impression of Death was warped in contemporary folklore and well-justified fear .   No , I never did care for all of that and all of them .   *Follow me . *   The man stood beside the figure of him resting serene and sound on the bed . The weight in between his brows had been lifted . He was that weight , he realised . He gave himself all that weight .   The man retreated from his lifeless body , which was to be discovered by his grandson bursting into the room demanding a playmate . He followed the flowing cape that he could not seem to properly see . It felt like it absorbed all the light and attention and everything else that ever fell on it .   Death led the way . As he left , the man smiled at a life well lived , and all the things that he never cared for .   -- -   I am building the Rift-Edoras universe , prompt by prompt .

'He fooled us all . Every single one of us , including myself . Clark Kent . Superman . He rid the world of evil and put an end to any future catastrophic disasters to come from space . The planet was finally safe and the people of earth rejoiced . Did n't last long . He..it started big . The president was the first to go . The Kyrptonian declared his rule of planet earth with little resistance . The small amount that did resist did n't last long . He plans to reborn Krytpon and rule the galaxy as the strongest being to live and rule over the strongest planet . There was a war between heroes and villains which all ended the same . With Him hovering over a wartorn battlefield enjoying the demise of his victories . The justice league fell hard . It only took him a year to take us down . I 've been sheltered for many years . I know Superman . I know his weakness . After studying him these past years I 've learned a lot more . And with the risky help of an unlikely ally , I will bring order back to this world . Most importantly I will bring justice to Kal'el . I am the night . I am Batman . '' The caped crusader lowered the pen used to write his possible last note . He turned to his ally and nodded . `` You ready ? ''   `` Ha . Ha . Ha . ''
The clearing was empty except for the two of us . Shadowy figures locked in battle , oblivious to the fury of the storm . Lightning flashed all around us as the fierce winds assaulted our rain soaked forms .   `` How does goodbye sound ? '' she asked with a definite cackle in her voice .   `` It never had to come to this you know . We are the last of our kind . '' I replied sadly . The damage was already done . She had gravely wounded me .   She laughed at me . `` Mine is by far the greater power . You were foolish to agree to meet me here . ''   `` I admit that you are stronger . I can not hope to defeat you using magic . '' I said slowly and very deliberately .   The crooked smile grew on her face . She raised her hands towards me to cast her final spell that would end my life .   `` Farewell fool . ''   `` Here we are , at the crossroads of the path you put us on . '' I whispered , leveling my Colt at her head . I turned my eyes away just as I pulled the trigger , ending her existence .   `` You know , in the end , I should have seen this coming . '' I mused , looking past the empty hospital bed next to me and into the brightly lit hallway . `` She always was such a disagreeable soul . ''
Their was a long pause after reading the letter . I looked up at my parents as they stared at me in shock and mild horror .   `` At all costs '' I said meekly breaking the silence . `` They..they wrote it wrong . ''   `` Oh for f ! @ # 's sake '' I heard my father say as he walked up and out of my bedroom . My mother followed suit with a blank expression . I followed behind her as she walked out the door , but her sudden and swift closing and locking of the door kept me inside my room . Keeping my ears to the door I overheard an arguement erupting outside . My mothers crying and my fathers yelling were the only things I could hear .   `` We failed honey..we failed ... '' I heard my mother wimper and wail to my father . `` I ca n't believe it , I ca n't f @ # kin ' believe it ! '' My father exclaimed . `` It 's no wonder he has to be kept indoors . It 's no wonder he ca n't lead a normal life ... '' I heard him say in suprisingly soft tones . `` Our boy 's doomed to leeching off others , with no thought of originality or..or ... simple moral deceny ... ''   Their was a long silence .   `` We 're going to have to accept it '' my father said breaking the veil of quiet .   `` Our son is a grammar nazi ... .. ''   EDIT : 'irony ' masks lazy writing .
Jason walked into his apartment after a hard day at the office .   He kicked off his dress shoes , and draped his coat on the couch , making a mental note to hang it up before he goes to bed .   `` Mike ? You here buddy ? '' Jason called out for his new roommate but he had gotten no answer .   Shrugging to himself he walked through to the kitchen to poor himself a drink . It had been a long day .   He poured himself a glass , but as we went to take a sip , Jason lost grip on the glass . It shattered on the floor , breaking the tile as well .   `` Fuck , there goes my damage deposit . ''   Jason swept up the broken tile and glass , but noticed something odd underneath the tile , it looked like to be a note .   Sitting at the table , the note read :   `` Jason   You 're being watched . Constantly .   You 're an experiment and everything has been part of a game .   And the game is almost done .   I 'm sending this letter from the future to the past . Hopefully it reaches you in time . It worked for me , so it should work for you .   You have to get rid of Mike . He 's the only other player .   Be careful . He might have also gotten a letter . ''   Just then , Jason heard the door creak open , and a hesitant voice ask if Jason was home .
Slitted hazel eyes stare back at me across a nose of two colors . Beige sits on the right , but does not stray far . It comforts itself where it is , sitting just above her right eye , but wandering down under her chin a the same time . Whiskers run wild , extending far further than the width of her head . Longer strands of hair similar to whiskers perch atop her eyebrows , though they are barely longer than her ears . Her ears , coated in grey that runs down to the left side of her nose . It flows down the rest of her coat , from nose to tail . It is powerful , yet kind . Specks of beige dot her coat , from that small stripe just on top of her forehead to the small mottled patch on her left side . The grey gives way to white at her paws , a stipe running up half her leg on her front left . Her tail twitches before her eyes close as she settles down against my leg once again .   She sleeps , but not silently . Her purring sinks into my leg as she dreams .
`` The future is awesome , '' Alex insisted , tucking a strand of his long blond hair behind his ear . `` All our needs are met . There is no hunger , no suffering . The government assigns everyone a job , and everyone gets paid a decent , living wage , and is happy to do it . There is no unemployment . Me , I 'm a writer , I get to sit around writing stories on Reddit all day ! I make ten thousand coinmarks a month . ''   `` The future is terrible , '' Shondra said , shaking her head and figiting nervously with the end of one of her long , black braids . `` The government assigns us the most horrible , grueling , manual-labor intensive jobs . I work double shifts at a restaurant and wash dishes , too . My husband was killed , broke his back in a shipping plant . Without his income , I do n't make enough coinmarks to be able to feed my family . My oldest daughter is going to be forced to start working next week -- she is eight . ''  
I was different , a simple young man , but I was an outcast . Never , and I mean ever did I got in , and now , since the accident . I can never be the same again . I was invited by my `` friends '' to go on an adventure . That little trip turned out on me being abandon in the woods . It was horrible , who would 've thought that they would leave me . I was alone ... or so I thought .   I was hiking for days , hunger and thirst was the only things that kept me going . Until I found it , my saving grace . His manor . He was an odd man , obsessed with the old machines , everything was so primitive . Steam machines everywhere , boilers galore . He was obsessed with them . When he found me , all he did was smile . And then I fainted .   I woke a times later . Yet , I felt different . I felt animalistic . Something was wrong . Then he walked in , and said these simple words , `` Hello my creature , you have been saved , now as you 're repayment for rescuing you , I ask if only one thing '' , I responded in an odd growl , '' and what 's that ? '' His response , '' save them all . ''
Lucas placed the briefcase down on the floor . Emanuel repeated the action with his own . The soldiers of their great gangs flanked them with the clothes and marks of their people . Lucas ' were draped in trenchcoats , suits and well worn beards . Emanuel 's were wrapped in undershirts , baggy jeans and crucifix tattoos .   The two liasons switched sides and inspected the contents of each others ' briefcases . As they moved back across the invisible line to their own gang members , they nodded .   `` Halt ! '' yelled a young , nasal voice . `` In the name of the law ! '' The two veteran drug runners turned to see two teenagers , one dressed in a sweatervest , with thick horn-rimmed glasses and the other in a hoodie with an emo-swoop haircut .   `` We 're here to take you down , bro ! '' threatened the emo swoop . Uzis raised and in mere seconds , both teenagers were limp piles of pockmarked flesh on the concrete- sputtering and convulsing in their death throes . The two drug runners looked at one another .   `` We better leave , '' commented Emanuel . They all disappeared into the night .
August 15 , 2024   It finally worked . Happy 24th birthday to me ! It took a while , but I was finally able to shrink myself to the size of an electron . I 'm currently standing on the shrinking platform ; the nucleus is way behind me and those little dots are the electrons zooming around . The atom I 'm currently studying is an osmium nucleus .   I 'm not sure I explained to you before why I was so adamant about doing this . After my father died of prostate cancer two years ago I decided to devote my graduate research on finding new novel ways to help other people with similar afflictions . I found out through prior research that a couple of osmium compounds actually exhibited promising anti-cancer activity . The reason I chose osmium instead of other elements to check out was because it 's much more abundant and potentially much cheaper to use if this blows up ( hopefully because of whatever findings I can dig up ) into the open market .   I 've been trying to catch an electron to ride , but they whizz by so fast I can barely see them ! I need to get close enough to the nucleus to study it , otherwise there 's no way I 'll be able to justify the expense of my experiment when I get back into normal size . Here 's to staying alive and hopefully a whole lot of luck comes my way .   Also , I 'm hungry . I really should n't have skipped out on those donuts before getting shrunk . Damn .  
“ Please God , let me win this one , ” you said , down on your knees before the big match .   And you won that one .   “ Please God , thank you God , thank you for the last one , please let me win the next one. ”   And win the next one you did .   “ Please God , thank you God , ” and so on and so forth , until you 've felled Federer , Djokovic , Murray , Nadal , and won Wimbledon .   Then the Australian Open .   Then the US Open .   Then suddenly you ’ re three years unbeaten . Then four . Then five .   “ Please God , end poverty in Africa , ” you say , getting the first pangs of guilt at your prayers all coming true .   That ’ s when things became worrying . When an entire continent was wiped out by a mysterious new disease that for some reason stopped itself at the Meditteranean .   “ Please God , do something about global warming. ”   And do something he did . The world and its five inhabited continents were plunged into an Ice Age .   “ Please God , let me win this one , ” you said after the diagnosis .   And the next one . And the one after that .   A thousand years later , you are undefeated , blessed with supreme immunity , the last living being upon the Earth . Then you wish you were dead . Then you die . And that cunt God finally gets his fucking jollies in .  
PART I   The salty air and sound of palm fronds mingling with the breeze awoke me from sleep . I could say I was awake now but a befuddled trail of thoughts and memories laid waste in my mind , so much that it would be hard to call my previous state restful . My mind reeled and the migraine kicked in . I looked to my left and eyed the opened crate of vodka nearby .   `` Rafiki ! '' I exclaimed , calling out for my monkey butler . I was grouchy and like a baby aching for the teet , I sought after care and attention . Before long , Rafiki swung down from over my right shoulder and landed at my feet , waiting for my command .   `` Fetch me two bananas and a canteen of water you miserable pet ! '' I swung my open hand in his direction to get him to move in haste , and he did as expected . I was aching for nourishment .   PART II   `` He did not drink the bottle ! '' Rafiki spoke in hushed tones with his wife in the branches of a low palm tree , inland .   `` Nonsense ! He must 've finished two of them last night , '' his wife retorted .   `` He did not drink one of the three that we poisoned , '' Rafiki quickly responded . His wife let out a sigh and flung fecal matter towards the ground in frustration .   `` When will this end , '' she asked rhetorically as she closed her fists and looked to the sky .  
From the moment I laid eyes on her , I was in love . She was perfect ; dark hair , tan skin , the most beautiful smile in the world . Taking a sip of my drink , I approached her .   `` Hey , '' I said , doing everything I could to sound confident .   `` Hello , '' she said in a enthusiastic voice . We spent some time talking . Her name was Rachel , and she had lived in Brazil for much of her life before moving to the States .   One thing led to another , and suddenly we were in my home kissing . As I went to undo her bra she stopped me .   `` Look , there 's something I need to be honest with you about before we continue . I -- uh -- I used to be a man '' she stuttered . I tried to hide the look of shock on my face but it was n't working .   `` There 's something I should tell you , too . I used to be a woman . '' Tears swelled in her eyes .   `` Why ca n't I find a normal man ? ! '' She exclaimed , running out of the house , slamming the door behind her . I was n't sure what happened , but it was probably for the best .  
The last bartender grinned as I signed the employment papers , then handed me a metal pipe with an odd scribbling on it .   `` What 's this ? '' I asked .   `` When someone walks in you listen to their story , then make an observational comment on what they say or look like . After that ? Hit 'em with this . It 'll knock them right off the stool , '' he said .   Then he pranced out of the front door yelling , `` I quit ! ''   This had to be a joke , I thought . I looked at every plaque , bottle , and furnishing . I 'd seen them all before , like someone took every memory and image of a bar and compiled a living mosaic .   The last bartender stormed back in .   `` I forgot something , sorry . What you 're holding , we call that . It 's so old , you probably ca n't read it , anyway , we gave it a nickname , because it looks like it hurts and it 's pretty straight , '' he said as he walked forward .   `` Well , what do we call it ? Looks like a bar to me , '' I contemplated his instructions and did just as he said : I swung at his eyes . His facial features twisted around the metal pipe as he jerked away and landed face first on the floor . He looked up with a bloodied forehead .   `` No , we call it the punchline . ''
You all look like nice people , you clean behind the ears like nice people do . You hold an attentive gaze like nice people do . I 'm glad to know the generator of my seed spent his time around nice people .   I 'm glad this is an open wake , lest the man I 'm addressing has no face in my mind .   In childhood he was good . He ruffled my hairs & taught yours truly here how to work a stick shift ... an ability now obsolete considering & all we do n't drive round here round these parts any more . I 'm glad to have learned things .   It was never a `` I 'll get on better w out you in my life , dad # neverfoget '' type thing . It was more the type thing where it did n't exactly matter . Life comes & you move thru it , type thing .   On which note , the bar is open & it is an open bar . Let 's drink till we snap flicks for the Gram & write captions like `` these people are the shit # blessed ''  
As the priest looked around him he realized the magnitude of what he was seeing . He was looking in to the face of the devil himself . The young girl he had fought so hard to save lay on the ground before him in a spider like stance . Her arms were twisted and she was leaning back with an evil grin . Bearing her teeth and growling as if she were a hell hound . Her eyes seemed to burn as bright as the forest around her . The priest held out his cross and recited every verse he could remember . The demon inside of her started speaking back in a foreign tongue he did not recognize . As the flames of hell spun around him and the girl he realized he and his God were defeated . The priest fell to his knees , the fire had completely eaten up the beautiful nature God had created . With the last bit of his strength the priest rose and went over to the young girl and placed his hand gently on her head . The demon girl froze as he said , `` I 'm sorry I could not save you . '' The demon in her retreated for just a brief second and he instead of the flaming hell eyes , he saw the bright sparkling blue eyes of the girl who had loved to laugh and play the piano . They disappeared as quickly as they had come and she lunged at his neck . The flames of hell then took the three of them down to the burning depths .
Hopefully not too late   He followed her up the stairs for another glimpse , he was so horny logic was n't making sense . Her short skirt was flirty , and oh so very dirty , and her eyes were wide and as blue as the tide . She went into a room , and not a moment too soon . He followed her in and hoped to commit a grave sin . Down on the bed she went , open her shirt he rent . Pulling down her skirt his movements were rough and curt . There her panties left and he suddenly felt bereft , staring at the pretty sight that looked oh so sweetly right . Her pussy was pink and slick and he burned from the top of his head to the tip of his dick . He pulled down his pants and went right at it , no foreplay for these two , they fucked like rabbits . On and on into the night it goes , orgasms from the ends of their hair to the tips of their toes . The next morning they woke and he had quite a stroke , for the beautiful woman from the night before was n't a woman , but a bloke .
A 30-something man with a lazy eye and a brown stylish coat huddled around the fire-filled barrel on the sidewalk . `` I do n't know how it even happened . I remember when there were good prompts . 'A wife kills her husband . Make me sympathize with both characters . ' ''   `` And then there 's this Jesus playing chess with Satan shit , '' spoke a pale younger man . The bags under his bloodshot eyes really complimented his bony cheeks . `` I ca n't believe it . Just dumb . ''   A vehicle with the metalwork of a skeleton loudly approached , rumbling the whole way . The metal slate covering the steam engine had a red skull-and-crossbones on it . The driver , someone in all-vinyl black clothing , stepped out . `` What kinda prompts are ya ? '' she said .   `` Good prompts . That are n't about superpowers , '' said the 30-something man without looking at the driver .   The driver stowed away her pistol and put her gloved hands above the fire . `` The Jesus Zombie prompts are coming down this sub , '' she said , pointing up the street from where she came . `` We might wan na move on to the next sub . ''   `` But where ? '' cried an old black man wearing a trenchcoat . `` Where can we possibly go ? ''   She looked at the old black man . `` R-Writing . It 's our best hope for now . ''
Madam Smithers tea party was indeed the scandal of the week . Nay , the month ! It is very doubtful that most of the kindly gentlefolk there had ever seen such appalling behaviour . Lord Bryon , you remeber him right ? The lude young inheritor of Charles and Josphine Bryon . The couple that died in the fire last May . OH , back to the point . Lord Bryon made one of his insanely rude jokes in the middle of the tea party . Just as we all began to bite into our tarts . Do you recall Madam Smithers ' tarts ? Not very good , but we all have better manners than to tell that old bag it . Oh dear , I do crack myself up . But so , Lord Bryon makes a joke in bad taste . Dearest friend do not ask me what the joke was , that is the least important part . His wife , the new one with the curly locks of blond . Well she had the gall to not only giggle like a young maiden , but also grab his wrist which caused her sleeve to move up . And do you know what we saw then ? Her wrist . How brazen , how crude we all thought . Has she no modesty ? Well , she was promptly hung in the town center the day after her trial . And the Lord Bryon married her younger sister the following day . You miss many a great things when you 're away at sea . I hope this finds you well Admiral Monde .   Sincerely , Baroness Geaux  
Christopher was hurt , badly . He had tried his best , but it was n't good enough .   `` Come out , Officer . We can talk about it . '' Somehow , Chris did n't believe the man on the megaphone . He thought to himself about what exactly they would parlay about if he came outside . Perhaps they wanted to talk about the corrupt officers he had shot . Perhaps they wanted to have a nice chat about the weather . Chris knew what was coming next . The Waco treatment ...   `` Sons of bitches.. You 're all corrupt bastards . You kill a dozen minorities a day and call it a pick-a-nick . You beat down the homeless and send them to the hospitals.. '' He said to no one in particular . He was shot up in half a dozen places.. The once nice cabin he took shelter in was covered in blood . He could barely hold up his pistol , let alone his high caliber weaponry .   `` Burn it down ! Burn this motherfucker down ! '' Some thug cop shouted into his radio . Chris heard it , but he knew that even without such Waco Siege tactics , he was on his last legs .   `` Some fuckin ' escape.. Some goddamned -- '' He paused , coughed a spray of crimson.. `` Some goddamned revolution.. '' He raised a pistol to his head as he smelled the flames ... `` I 'm sorry . I failed us . I failed my family.. '' As the flames licked the inside of the cabin , he pulled the trigger .   It was time to say goodnight .
My parents told me Winston was coming back today . For the past few months he 'd been at grandma 's house . I do n't know why he was there , they said Winston wanted to be on grandma 's farm but I know Winston . He does n't like the outdoors . He just likes sleeping .   `` Hey sport , '' Dad tousled my hair , `` We 've got a big surprise for you ! '' Then my mom opened the front door and Winston bounded through . He licked my dad , he licked me , he even licked the couch . I grabbed him and I started petting him . Winston had this green collar on his neck though , with a name tag attached to it . I gave Winston a blue collar a long time ago so I checked it . The tag said Luke . `` Dad I do n't think this is Winston , '' and I looked at him . I wanted my dog . This was n't my dog .   Mom looked at dad too , `` You said he would n't notice , '' and dad smiled , probably because he was stuck between the crossfire of his kid and wife . He said , `` It 's okay sport . You wo n't even notice Winston 's gone . ''   I ran outside . I 'll go to grandma 's farm and I 'll find Winston myself .
Dear The Man I Lost My Virginity To ,   I talked about you today . The first time in a long time , but I did it . It 's been so damn long . It took me a while to talk about our history , how things went , how we knew each other . How things ended . But I did it .   You were older than me , by a good few years , and we did n't know each other long ( a couple of weeks at the most , right ? ) but your brother really wanted to host that small party . Everyone was there , and the drinks were flowing . I admitted I was a virgin during a drinking game . I was so embarrassed ( looking back , having your virginity at 18 was n't something to be ashamed of ) but you had that confident smile on your face .   I still remember the feeling of you inside of me . I remember the words you said to me as the sun rose whilst your girlfriend was upstairs asleep . I remember the pain . I remember the tears . I remember the bloodied bath I took hours later . I remember taking the morning after pill . I remember the doctor asking if I consented . I remember telling him `` I do n't know . ''   My therapist wants me to press charges . But how could I ? You were my first .   From ,
A rouge planet . Lost in the cold , empty cosmos . The nearest nebulae was lightdecades away , there was no star here . No source of external heat , no supernovae nearby to end it 's solitary existence . It was dark , and drifting .   Beneath the crust , over millions of year , life had found it 's way here still . It evolved and thrived near the vents spurred active by the hot iron core deep inside the planet . Over the countless number of years it became aware , discovering love , gods and loss . Scientific thought came next , followed closely by curiosity .   The studied , postulated , and guessed under hundreds of miles of thick rocky crust , living out their days to understand what was beyond the roof of their existence . Still hundreds of miles below the surface , they worked to penetrate the inner layers to discover what was `` out there . ''   Time passed and lives were lost in their journey to understand what was above until finally , they broke through . It was then that those first explorers lost faith in their gods . They realized they were Alone , they understood they were drifting and if life existed outside of their planet they would before they were found . This knowledge would destroy them .   They would arrange an accident , hoping to cause loss of public support to cease the studies . They would sacrifice themselves to spare the shame of a long sought after dream.They would retreat inside their planet , back to the warmth of understanding and forget their loneliness . Theirs was the place where no star gave light .
Kings . What do you know about Kings , Joseph ?   Kings rule , Kings lead , Kings destroy .   Kings die , new kings replace them .   Some kings are remembered , some kings are forgotten .   Just kings are regaled for their triumphs for hundreds of years .   But kings are a curse , Joseph . Kings have so little in common with us , but so much control .   Kings treat the commoners with contempt and fear .   Kings allowed no one to truly better himself . Nothing can change without the approval of the kings .   But the time of kings came to an end .   Nearly all kings were deposed , and the kings that survived lost their real power .   Without kings we have flourished .   We chose our own leaders . We forged our own paths . Despite some bumps along the way , we have improved our lives .   It seemed that nothing could truly stop us anymore .   But its a funny thing , Joseph , about our leaders now .   Less and less , do they represent us . Less and less do they change . More and more , they treat the rest of us with contempt and fear .   More and more are they in control , while the rest of us are forgotten .   In all but name , they are kings .
Gandalf was a clever wizard who manipulated many events to suit his own desires . When a group of dwarves wanted to reclaim their ancestral home , this fitted his plans and so he helped them . He knew it would require a creature who could behave with stealth and so he brought along a young hobbit called Bilbo .   During the journey they had several fights and Bilbo found a magical ring that made him invisible . On arrival at the mountain they found the dragon who occupied it was not friendly , but they drove it from the mountain to a nearby village , where it was shot and died .   The mountain was full of gold and soon there were armies of creatures who wished to take it from the dwarves . The armies clashed and then orks attacked ; the dwarves were able to compromise , share some small measure of their wealth and the armies combines to destroy the orks .   The dwarves reclaimed their home , the hobbit went home with some gold and Gandalf got what he wanted , the world had been changed just enough to fit in with his plans .
It started off great .   I 'm off to America , to work there and fulfill my dreams .   My head is still dizzy from last night 's farewell party , we watched many nostalgic videos and laughed at it to the point where i did n't get enough sleep . I 'm lucky that my seat is the window seat . I put on my headphone as soon as the plane is up in the air , enjoyed the last sight of my country until it disappear under the cloud before closing my eyes and sleep .   I woke up to strong vibration , and i could hear the sound of winds . Seems that we are getting a turbulence . So i woke up and fixed my sitting position when i realized something .   That old couple sitting next to me is gone . Not just them , the passenger beside them too . I looked back , the family of three have disappeared as well . There is nothing but porn magazine in the seat in front of me .   A loud *bing* surprised me . I glanced up and the notification of wearing your seat belts have gone .   -gtg i 'll continue later-  
`` I did n't stab that man twenty six times in the chest . '' I do n't deny that I wanted to , but I do n't acknowledge their angry claims that I did . `` I also did n't stab any of the other victims . ''   `` We did n't say you did . In fact , we did n't say that the victim died of any stab wounds at all , much less allude to the exact number . Nor did we mention that there had been any other victims discovered . ''   I did n't say anything else . I did n't need to . The judge did n't even need to issue a search warrant , since I did n't remember to hide the evidence . The police did n't need to go any further into my property than the window into my basement dungeon that I did n't have time to draw the blinds on .   The jury did n't find me innocent . They did n't let me go free . The governor did n't pardon my execution . I did n't have any last requests . I did n't go to Heaven .
`` Mr. President , sir , please , what is happening ? Is the human race doomed ? Or is n't it ? ''   It had been 30 minutes . 30 minutes since some pencil neck spotted the comet hurtling towards earth with a ridiculous toy he bought on the internet . We wanted to keep this a secret , just let the human race die with dignity . Now the press swarmed my podium like a bunch of bees , hoping for something anything .   I had nothing , I was never a good speech writer . Oh I could make a crowd cry red , white and blue tears with my public speaking , but I never had the chops for writing the speeches themselves . Who cares anyway ? We 're all gon na die .   `` Mr. President are the rumors true ? ''   I tapped the mic , sighed , and said `` No comment . ''   The crowd burst to tears and cheers , people screaming , hugging , reporters barking happily into their cell phones and tweeting as fast as their crooked thumbs allowed . Confused , I exited the podium backstage , to see my team huddled around a flat screen , watching the news .   Shots of people all around the world were cheering .   `` We 've just been given confirmation from the President himself ! '' said the reporter among a sea if happy masses . `` No comet ! No comet ! Confirmed by the President himself ! '' The reporter dropped his mic and was swept up in the crowd , hugging and singing .   Well , this is n't dignified , but hell , this ai n't such a bad way to go .
`` Right . Do n't know how much time I have . Have to make this quick . Invest in Apple computers , they get super rich in the 2000s . Just a heads up , I realize there 's nothing you 'll be able to do about it but I 'm morally obligated to warn you that terrorists will crash planes into the twin towers on September 11 , 2001 . Again , nobody you know is hurt so you 're not really affected , and you wo n't be able to do something about it , just a heads up . Dang , I wish I could give you lotto numbers but I do n't have any handy . Oh and one last thing . Whatever you do , do n't `` And then the portal closed . So strange , I wonder who that was . Never gave me his name . One thing was for certain , he was clearly crazy . Macs are stupid expensive . That 's why their market share is so low . Still better than an IBM compatible , but it 'll never have the market share that the Amiga has . One million sold , and that 's just in the last year ! And besides , who 'd attack the twin towers . They 're in the middle of South Dakota , nothing for miles . Clearly crazy .
The wind wound its way through the trees , down the slope and across the glade , brushing over the long grass . It gently carried warmth , and the scent of fauna and flora . A breath of the wild . He had known it already , and yet , in that moment , it felt , smelt fresh .   Ancient statues littered the basin . He wondered what purpose they held . With nothing more to the place than a natural beauty , he thought perhaps tombstones . A quiet place to rest . As though some piece clicked into place , the wind whispered . He could n't make out what it said , but his ears strained , always on the verge of understanding and never quite getting there .   Calming his breathing to silence , he then closed his eyes . Murmurs circled him . Still unable to decipher them , he found himself at a loss . After shaking his head to clear the growing frustration , he let out a long breath .   Another piece clicked . He stilled , and two words rang clearly .   “ Go onward. ”   And , he did .
Simply put , my soul is conflicted . My beautiful wife and two children smile at me every time I open my wallet , but my lover smiles at me whenever I open my mouth . My wife loves that I provide for and emotionally support our family , but she does n't love *me* anymore . Clara , on the other hand , ca n't go a day without texting me just to see how my day is going . She not only appreciates the things I do , but who I am as well . I never meant for things to get so out of hand with my relationship . I only wanted a friend to talk to . I never meant to invite her into my family 's house while my kids were at school and my wife was at work . I could n't predict that my daughter would come home early and see me with Clara on the couch . Words ca n't describe the emotion in her eyes . Hatred ? Anger ? Betrayal ? Now I 'm faced with an ultimatum : cut off all ties with Clara , my soul mate , and stay with my supportive family or cut off all ties from my kids , my pride and joy , so I can be with the person who makes me the happiest that I 've ever been .
You panic as you try to remember what you possibly could have done . Honestly You do n't even remember where you are or how you got here . A bead of sweat rolls down your face as your mind races . Was it that time that you stole from the corner store ; or perhaps that time you accidentally burned down the camper . No it must be something worse then that ; why else would there be this many people waiting for the verdict . Finally you just shutdown and wait for the inevitable judgement . A man comes from the left of the stage and you notice that he almost looks fake . He puts a hand on your shoulder and a smile spreads across his face ; `` Are you ready to go ? '' the man asks . You just shake your head sure you that even if you were n't it would n't matter . The man walks away and suddenly the lights flash on the crowd illuminated and music begins to blast from behind you . You sit there in silence and you realize that three people are sitting behind a bench in front of you . You turn around and see a gigantic neon sign which reads Britain 's got talent . You turn around and look around with disbelief ; trying to figure out what to say only one thought comes to mind . In one attempt to escape the awkward situation you mutter `` But I 'm no British ... ''
The words not guilty rang in my ears , and how great they sounded . I 'd stood on the stand and prayed that I would hear those two words . I wanted to be able to look at the jury and think 'Yeah , I fooled you guys too . '   I was n't innocent , far from it in fact . It *was* me who sliced those women 's throats . It *was* me who had posed them in the park , looking like they were reading intently . It was also me who had taken photographs of the things they 'd suffered before I killed them . However , I had everyone fooled . Nobody thought I was capable of something like that , I was 'such a good guy ' .   It would have been a great catch for the cops if they 'd managed to actually get any evidence against me , but hell , they had n't even found my kill room . It was there for anyone to find . All they had to do was look deeper in my apartment , but no , they missed it .   And now ... Now I was free to continue on the road I had paved so well .
Bob 's kitchen was a mess . He reminded himself to clean it next Saturday , the hundredth time he had given himself that reminder . But right now he needed a bowl to make ramen . He looked around , but most of the bowls cluttering his counter tops were growing different varieties of mold . He opened the dishwasher , but it was empty . Opening the first cabinet found only Tupperware , and he needed something microwave safe . He opened the cabinet above his stove , but the tiny cabinet door was holding back a wave of dishes and his cutlery wrack .   As the knife wrack fell it spun and sprayed him with assorted steak and bread knives . For the most part he would be fine . A few small cuts , but nothing to worry about . Except that large gash running down his arm . It was bleeding alarmingly quickly . As he began to feel light headed he turned to grab his phone ; unfortunately it was buried somewhere on his counter .   He was getting weaker , suddenly he realized how strong gravity was and he fell to his knees . He called for help , but he lived alone . Seconds later and he collapsed to the floor . He whispered for help one last time as blood pumped from his arm .   And then Bob died .
It 's the usual tired , mainly of living . Sleep is a decent escape from it all . Stay in bed as long as you can . The best it will ever be is neutral . One needs to be at the top of the mountain for that and usually one resides near the bottom . It can sometimes sink down into the negatives like you 're a losing contestant on a game of jeopardy . That is when things get heavy .   The weeks , months , and years can go fast but the days always go so slow . Energy required for even the basics is unbelievably high . Shower , brush teeth , wash face , look presentable , or even a decent meal those are the low level challenges that feel like one needs the stamina of a marathon runner to even stand a chance . School or work is sometimes hard and sometimes not . The body and mind can be trained to show up on time and do a decent job .   Apologies but one can never look or sound like they did n't wish to have jumped in front of the train or rode against traffic on their way over today . Minimal eye contact please . Sorry it can still be heard all day in one 's voice . More money ? Less work ? Those mean nothing of course . Necessary for living but ca n't be used to purchase an antidote . Before leaving the house one needs to be filled with their personal poison of choice . One can literally count the moments when their poison is going strong and the pain of everyday has temporarily faded away .
`` Ah , is n't the air lovely today ? Cool and crisp , whistling all around me . Its so great to have this nice break from that dank little place I 'm normally put . Its so cramped , there 's hardly any air around me at all in there ! Out here , though , out here there 's so much space !   `` Haha , whoa ! Easy there buddy ! This swinging around is fun and all , but its making me a bit dizzy ! Ouch ! Oh , hello new friend ! You look just like me ! Is n't this so weird , we look the same but we keep getting slammed into each other . Aaaand this is new . Now I 'm in some sort of dark , red space . Man , it 's wet in here , and even more cramped than that other place I usually am ! What 's that hard white stuff ? I guess I 'm back in the air again . Bye new friend ! ''   Kronug the barbarian shook the blood from his `` intelligent '' sword , quietly cursing whatever idiot wizard made this thing .
Silently , I drift along , quieter than any mouse . The very air you breath is my weapon , my vector , my highway , to assault you , and there is no defense . I come at any hour of the day or night , in more than half the houses in America . There in your home , lurking , waiting to burst free and wreak havoc !   You ca n't see me coming , and by the time you notice me , it 's too late !   You 're caught in a vile , horror-inducing panic , your arms flailing about and your face screwed up in a visage of pain and disgust . `` Aggghh ! What ! Again ? ! `` , you wail in your agony , sometimes running from the room , returning with aerosol chemicals that , too late , sometimes work to alleviate the overload .   But my source , He , who produces me , lays there unaware that he 's 'done it again ' , sometimes even while sleeping . He looks at you , now with his big puppy eyes as only he can , his tail thumping happily against the floor , and you swear , ...   `` Damned dog farts are the worst ! ''  
A small metal piece lay under the lip of the second drawer . Fumbling with it yielded some very interesting results .   A secret compartment ? My mind screamed .   Granddaddy was an established spy back in the old days , travelling between many countries . He told me stories of wit and fear , tales that took on some dark turns and sometimes were slightly too preposterous to be true .   Granddad also had a knack for finding things during his long walks in the woods . He 'd come back with a wooden amulet for my sister one time , or a small shark tooth sculpture another . Indiscernible tools and quirky machinery were littered around his shed .   Fiddling with the tab , a soft sliding sound was heard . The drawer popped open slightly . The construction was simple , a slightly deeper compartment lay within the woodwork , with the normal drawer inside the deeper one .   The papers were kept in thick files . Large warning labels and stampings blanketed the leather covers .   Undoing the binding , i slowly poured the contents onto the table , sorting and arranging them .   I stood in shock . I stood in awe .   The folder was his lifelong secret , his massive and final collection .   Approximatley 5 kilograms of furry porn lay in front of me , resourced from his contacts , from around the world .
Adolf 's mother pushed his long , black bangs out of his eyes for the picture . `` You should show your face , honey , it 's so beautiful . ''   The photographer snapped the picture too soon for Adolf to correct his mother 's mussing . `` Mo-om ! '' Adolf complained , pushing his mother away while combing his bangs back the way he liked them . `` My hair shields my eyes from the pain of the world ! You 'll never understand me ! ''   Adolf stormed off and went to write in his little black book with his poems in it . *I dedicate this poem to Freyde , the cute Jewish girl down the street who always turns me down . *   *Swirling cyclones of pain surround*   *My heart in chains , shackle-bound*   *'Freyde ' means 'release ' , never to be found*   *For in my*   His poem was rudely interrupted by another American schoolboy who came charging after him with a gun in hand . `` I come from the 1990s ! '' the boy exclaimed , `` to save the world from your tyranny ! ''   `` Shoot me , then ! '' Adolf challenged him . `` Death holds no pain that I 've not yet suffered in this life ! All I have is my art , my poems , and you even interrupt those ! ''   Shocked and inspired , the boy returned to his home time in the 1990s .   And that 's how emo was born .
People of Earth . Please , listen . As you may know , every world leader has been killed . You may not believe me , but I , indeed , speak the truth . Now , brothers and sisters , we , as humans , as a species , have two choices : We can continue on this path of separation and destruction , continually dividing country , race , party , religion OR we can become one . The internet has given us access to vast information and instant communication . We know we COULD feed everyone on the planet , we know everyone COULD have clean water , we know we COULD house all the homeless , but we do n't because most of us are just about there and the system certainly does n't make it easy .   Know that what I 'm asking may be violent . As you have already seen , bloodshed will be necessary , but it is for the good of the world and the future . Everyone on earth will be a part of this , whether you are with us , or against us . Know that all we seek is peace and a world of justice . This begins the revolution , it will be televised . You have been warned .
`` Yuck ... '' You 'd think that the same species that put a man on a moon could make the taste of whiskey a little more bearable , but here I am barely able to take a pull after 133 years on this planet . I drink only on the nights when I have to take a life . Usually a few shots of bourbon , maybe some vodka , a year ago today I think my choice was gin , but I 'm not completely sure . Not remembering was the point of the alcohol in the first place , and although I do n't remember what I drank I can fully remember the faces of my undeserving victims with traumatic vividness . I am haunted by them , whenever I close my eyes I see their faces pleading to me for mercy , mercy I did not give . My immortality acts only like a vacuum for death , for my life is filled with the lives of others .   I do n't intend on giving him anymore lives than I already have , for tonight I plan on ending my own . I looked over my shoulder and saw that I had ten minutes left before my deadline , ten minutes before he would end my life for not fulfilling my end of the bargain , but I did not plan on giving him the satisfaction . My feet dangled from the seventh floor I dropped the whiskey bottle before I followed .   *Crash* went the whiskey bottle   Thud   I woke up the next morning , and saw him sitting at the foot of my bed , one more life gets you one more year he said wickedly before vanishing

He just looked at it . `` No '' , He thought . `` This can not be right . It _must_ not be right . Someone , somewhere , has made an error . I would have known ! ''   God started walking back and forth . A thought popped up , seemingly from nowhere : `` I might have known and then forgotten . ''   He stopped walking . `` But I do not forget . I am God ! I see all . I know all . I am ... ''   God started feeling uncomfortable . He had never felt that way before . The full understanding of this discovery crept into His consciousness . He panicked .   `` No ! This is a truth I do not wish to embrace . I must forget again . If I have made myself forget before , I can make myself forget again . I must ... I must . ''   The sorrow and pain of God could be felt across the universe . Worlds crumbled and died , one by one , until there was nothing . Then He forgot .   Somewhere in the back of His mind , the words were still there , hidden even from him . They would come back from time to time , and when they did , he would once again destroy the universe and start over . Those words would haunt him for the rest of eternity : `` God is all . There is nothing but God . ''
How did I get in this situation ? I thought . Across from me was Isabella , the sole reason I ended up in State . She was cruel yet tender , cold but warming , calculating but daring . I do n't know why on earth that I fell in love with her but i did .   `` Did you hear me Alison ? '' She asked .   `` Sorry dear , I was in thought . What were you saying ? '' I explained .   `` Maggie and her dreading of a husband are on their way . '' She repeated . I groaned .   Maggie was my younger sister , while she was nice and loving ; her husband on the other hand is cruel . I have seen him hit her when he thought no one was looking . Hell he even forces her to have sex even if she does n't want to . The only reason ( from what I was told ) that she stays with him is because he takes care of the kids .   `` Hey love ? ''   `` Yeah ? ''   `` Can you come up with a way to separate them ? '' I asked .   `` Of course . '' She said .   The gears started turning in her head . This is why I loved her , and the reason why I forgave her .
I was watching Girls Gone Wild and ran out of lube , I needed a solution fast . I put two fingers to my forehead and imagined a bottle of lube . Yes , that particular brand I like . It was in a particular store I visited quite often . The bottle of lube floated up into the air and soared through the window , shattering it and spraying glass everywhere . The black cap tilted upwards and shot through the air with incredible speed , Tom could feel the pressure given off by this bottle of lube in his hyper focused dream state . His eyes widened suddenly , he needed nachos from the gas station next door . Toms eyes closed with focus and focused on the nachos . The nachos waited patiently for a man to open the door and then the nachos leapt into the air , targeted on the opening in the door . He imagined it so perfectly , his will must be done . Opening his eyes Tom put on his silk robes and navigated to the front door , he needed to use his telekinetic power to take out the garbage , another chore he had to do . Opening the front door a beaming ray of sun blinded Tom , squinting he put his hand over his eyes to see better .   --   The demon saw Tom standing in the doorway , a perfect target . The demon knew the perfect spell to make the plastic container disappear . He was tired of holding the bottle of lube at this exact specified angle . The contents would land perfectly on Tom . He smiled devilishly , he could n't resist .
`` You know , Pickering , '' said the man , `` first impressions are quite important when meeting new people , and can really be rather polarizing . For instance , if you saw *this* young man '' - the stranger yanked one arm up to point to a passerby- `` for the first time , you would think him to be almost a child in mental state , and would deal with him accordingly . Look , see ! His youthful face and curly , unkempt dirt-blonde hair do nothing to dissuade that image , nor does his slight , gangly build . The dullness of his blue eyes speaks of the exhaustion that comes from a poor sleep schedule ; however , it is the kind of exhaustion motivated more by an unwillingness to waste time sleeping than by any necessity . He would almost resemble a young boy , were it not for his height . Look at his behavior , too ; he shuffles awkwardly , as though he does not know what he does or where he goes , and he averts his gaze from the eyes of others . See , now ! He has reached the bus stop , and grows impatient already . He can not restrain himself ; his fingers twiddle themselves , his feet tap rhythmically , and his eyelids fall shut . I 'll wager , in his mind , he 's all but forgotten the bus stop already , lost in some fantasy far more entertaining to him than the drudgery of the everyday . ''
Citizens . Your governments and their armies have fallen and I stand before you the victor . But know this , the pain and suffering you all felt during this conquest was not in vain for when those corrupt bastions fell their petty politics and corrupt moralities went with them .   I stand before you now not solely as a conqueror but as a symbol for your hopes and dreams , there shall be no more war , no more hunger , no wants or desires left unfulfilled .

None shall hope or dream for your minds will be stripped of these barbaric urges .   But citizens do not panic , for the process to purge your flaws begun as this speech started , the signals broadcast around the world with my voice , the process is irreversible .   However , I am not a cruel man , I gift you 10 seconds to say goodbye to those you love , before you forget what love is .   Strength in Unity . Unity in Mind .  
Bright . That 's all I can say to describe it . The light was bright .   Memories trickled back to me , and then I felt the pain . It was excruciating , the mangled limbs and her shrill screams . My heart leapt into my throat with a sudden panic . Where was she ?   I was battling the light then , squinting to push past it . Things only became slightly clearer , and I realized then that I was running . More precisely , I was sprinting . Colors swirled around me as I passed them in a haze . I had to find her .   I heard a laugh . A soft , light hearted laugh . A genuinely happy laugh . I halted , spinning on my heel .   The light seemed to dim and everything shifted into focus . I saw her . She was standing alone in a grassy field , looking right at me , giggling as if I was silly for running , for panicking .   She seemed to float towards me , the care free spirit she always was . I wanted to ask her so many questions , I wanted to demand explanations . But , as I felt a smile creep across my face , I could only utter one word ,   `` Skylar . ''
I remember hunting for crawfish and searching for duck eggs along the riverbeds near my grandparent 's house . They 're dry now . Little more than rocks and overgrown brush .   Things do n't last . But memories do .   Always being different , moving far too often to lay roots anywhere . Learning to be unattached to 'things ' , because it 's easier to never be attached , than it is to get attached and lose them . No lasting friends to speak of , but learning how to make them quickly . It 's better than being alone .   I grew up a nomad , and I wanted a place I could call home . I chose this city and decided it would be my home . I worked hard , I was lucky . I 've lived making no compromises , and have no regrets . I have things now .   A girlfriend I love .   Employees that are like a second family .   A business that I poured my life into . One that allows me to provide for others in my life .   I do n't drive a fancy car . I do n't own a big house . But the restaurant lets me help people in need . I can make a difference .   I am happy . I have things I do n't want to lose . This is new to me .   *exactly 200 words*
“ Captain , we are getting closer to Prison Planet 42 . The shields are on maximum just as procedure . The computer started to analyze the data from the planet and close surroundings. ”   “ Thank you lieutenant , continue . Let me know if any of the prisoners are still alive. ”   The science officer who was there to represent the Queen ’ s interest , was quite surprised by the results of the findings . He just shouted : “ Bloody hell , that is impossible. ”   “ What ’ s wrong Doc ? ” - asked the Captain .   “ They are still alive . Not just alive but thriving . I don ’ t believe this . 200 thousand local years ago when we dropped these so called humans in this planet we were sure they ’ re going to die here . This planet is a perfect prison planet . Most of its land covered by water , constantly changing climate and weather . Not to mention the plenty of local species which could kill us within a short period of time . They ’ ve killed all other species on their origin planet without even a second thought . The empire had to do something without upsetting its citizens since all life equal . So we brought them here. ”   “ Thank you Doc , that is enough . I ’ m familiar with the history. ”   As they were thinking about what they should do next , the alarm went off on the bridge loudly . But not for long . Within 5 seconds there was only debris in the place of the spaceship .   And the space-junk just got a little bit bigger around Earth .
`` You 're shitting me mom ! '' I yelled into the phone .   `` Yeah it happened really quickly I was just calling to make sure you 're ok ... '' My mothers voice sounded detached and unfamiliar .   I looked longingly at the shotgun hung up on the wall , encased in a wooden frame with a piece of glass on the front bearing the words `` in case of zombie apocalypse , break glass '' .   `` Mom I did n't even get to break my shotgun out of the really cool thing I made ! '' I was getting angrier by the minute , `` How did the zombie apocalypse happen ? And how did it only last one night ? ''   `` Well apparently the CDC deployed all the resources they had , with massive amounts of government workers just flooding the streets . It was impressive to see actually . We thought you would have been watching the news last night ? '' My mom confirmed my deepest fears .   I had gone to bed early because my boss had asked me to come into work early on a Saturday . On a Saturday ! I missed the zombie apocalypse because of my boss ! Thanks Janice !
The elevator lurched to a sudden halt , and the people inside gasped loudly .   `` The elevator has been stopped just above the 10th floor . It will only function if there is only one of you left alive . Please act accordingly . This is not a joke . ''   The occupants look utterly confused and terrified as they talked among themselves , trying to decide what they should do . One burly man attempted to pry the doors open . A teenage boy started crying , while a middle-aged woman consoled him . A young woman in the corner looked like she was in the early stages of a panic attack .   We watched on the screens as the people in the doomed elevator conspired with each other . I figured they would try to work together in the beginning , but eventually , after the hunger and desperation settled in , they would turn on each other . It would only be a matter of time .   I sat watching the screens closely , as my fellow gamblers did the same around me . The teenage boy , who had looked so strong and capable , was now blubbering into his mother 's chest . Damn it . I bet on him to be the one to survive . $ 10,000 down the fucking drain .
Tom began to slowly open his eyes , then jolted upright with a sudden gasp of breath . He was in the middle of the woods , and the autumn leaves were stuck to his naked body by a mixture of dried blood and mud .   Horrified , Tom clambered to his feet and tried his hardest to brush off the nauseating muck . His stomach churned grossly in failure—unable to completely rid himself of the filth—and he heaved , throwing up an unrecognizable , bloody meal .   Tom fell to his knees , shivering in the cold . He saw the droplets of blood dribbled across the forest floor half a dozen feet away . The knot in his gut tightened , but he rose—feeling an innate responsibility to see the carnage with his own eyes , to be absolutely positive—and followed the trail . At first , it was difficult , then it became sickeningly easy as the dribble became less sparse .   He fell against a tree , overwhelmed with relief at the sight of the dead deer . *At the sight of its scattered intestines and torn jugular , * he thought , suddenly mortified . *Oh god , next time , you won ’ t be so lucky . It ’ s gon na be a kid next time . Next time , you ’ re gon na cut a kid to ribbons . *  
You 're married . You 're married and it 's beautiful and the sun makes his brilliant blue eyes sparkle as he looks at you and brushes a dark curl back and you 're breathless as you snap the camera .   `` Your turn . '' you smile and step down from the marble stair , your dress billowing out behind you as you hand him the camera ( carefully of course ) and flounce towards the carved bench , deigning to arrange yourself on it with a dignified half-smile .   He makes a face , rolling his eyes and grimacing , and your resolve breaks , falling into a smirk .   `` Jerk . '' but you ca n't halt the smile that stretches across your face and you just want to laugh and cry and sing and mostly yell to the heavens that he is yours and you are his .   And as you stand and you cross the space and pull him close , his arms wrap around you and all you can do is marvel at this perfectly imperfect man that you love , the storm in his eyes rages only for you and the ebony curls curl so well beneath your fingers and his lips , parted slightly , are made for yours and you reach up on your toes and press yours against his and-   You wake in an instant . Immediately your fingers stretch out but meet only blank space , grasp only at cold sheets .   *you know better . *   You dissolve into silent sobs , curled into your bed in the darkness .   the photographs sit at the bottom of your bag , waiting .  
He clambered down the narrow hallway , his toe just nearly missing the rusty radiator he often stubbed it on . Like a ship in a storm , he swayed back and forth with each progressive step until he finally stumbled into the kitchen . He paused and muttered a few unintelligible words to himself groaning as he reached towards the cupboard . His hand reached the top shelf and fumbled aimlessly in search of a glass . While his fingers crawled back and forth desperately , he suddenly caught a glimpse of what looked to be a glass resting peacefully in the back of the cupboard . Determined to grasp it , he prepared his legs , and made a pitiful leap , swatting his hand toward the seemingly unreachable glass . With each successive hop , he felt closer and closer to clenching it . On his fifth attempt , the tip of his fingers swiped the glass , and it danced playfully around the top shelf . The glass tipped slightly sideways balancing dangerously as it spun in circles around and around . Frantically , the man made one last hop , but his judgement was poor and he grossly miscalculated . His hand bashed the bottom of the top shelf sending the glass tumbling off the edge and over his head . He could n't bear to look ; he closed his eyes and heard the resounding crash of shattered glass against the cold tile floor . Slumping to the ground he whimpered quietly . His fingers reached forward , shaking , as he pinched a broken shard of his only known escape , and a tear trickled slowly down his face .
`` We think they said something along the lines of , 'aww , look it 's so cute , ' sir . '' I looked up to my superior . `` Should we ... should we deploy another ? ''   `` Why waste the resources ? '' She asked . Sending another rover to Mars just so it can be taken as a pet ! ? '' She pinched the bridge of her nose .   `` Why have n't they responded to any attempted contact ? '' The engineer of our think tank spoke up .   `` They probably think we 're idiots , '' I said .   `` If nothing else they think we 're cute , '' our psychologist joked .   `` Real funny , '' our superior must be fed up with us . `` Deploy three more , and you better be able to speak in their language by this weekend . ''   `` Languages do n't work like ... '' I was cut off simply by the look in her eye . `` On your orders . ''   -- -   `` Look its three more ! '' `` Aww , adorable ! '' The Martian colonist scratched the rover under its camera , `` I 'm gon na name you rocker-bogie ! Wan na come home with me ? '' It picked up the rover and carried it into a dust storm , then transmission was lost .
The drone immediately took off as it dropped the package in my entryway . “ Thanks ! ” I shouted at the seemingly indifferent robot . The box was smaller than I imagined it would be . To be honest there was nothing spectacular about the packing at all . It was just a small brown cardboard box , sealed tight with the black sequenced Amazon logo tape -- corporate branding at its finest . I picked up the package and walked to my desk area to get some scissors to break the seal . And as I put the box down , that ’ s when I noticed the wet spot in the bottom corner . It was freezing to the touch . “ A leak ! Son of a bitch , ” I thought to myself . With my scissors in hand I started to snip at the tape on both sides , my other hand angling the package . I slowly pulled apart the outer top flaps of the box , to reveal the closed inner top flaps , when … . *WHOOOOOOOSH ! * The box sprung open letting out a bright and loud bellowing gust of cold energy . With all the strength I could muster , I reached for the flaps and closed the box . “ Stupid… ” I muttered to myself . “ Never spend good money on prototypes ! ” I exclaimed out loud .
A million times the gavel came down and a million and one times I was guilty . Did I care ? Yes . Did I deserve it ? Yes , well , I mean I was guilty ... but that 's not the same thing is it ?   As my mind raced and my imagination sent me down again and again I realised I was forgiving myself . These small , imagined reparations were easing my guilt and allowing me some respite . I indulged myself yet again and hated myself for it .   The seat they put me on in court was uncomfortable and the air conditioner was running too high . Her family were there , all warm in their coats with their tears and their comfortable hate .   The gavel fell and the mouths in the room filled with air .   I walked out some days later , alone and free . I sat on the corner and I had a sandwich and a coffee . I breathed her air and I ate her sandwich . I drank her coffee and I read her time on my watch . For 5 minutes I lived in the space reserved for her life .   That was months ago and I do n't live in her space now . It was n't really hers after all , did she deserve it ? Probably not , I will probably make better use of it .   Edit : I thought I should note that I am aware this is shoddy as hell . I am trying to experiment with a few things and , so far it needs work ha . Also , gavel not gable !
Satan awakened in darkness , confused . He forgot where he was and what had happened . And who the people around him were . Apparently , the people he killed . But what he does n't remember is that there was a rebellion in hell against himself , and he had died . But now under his feet lied a gravel terrain and tons of fog . There seemed to be a night of red skies . He walks around running into many pitch black rocks int he darkness to find a cave . But he does n't want to risk that . This place was confusing as it was . This place ? An unfamiliar second afterlife .   There is a big groan heard from miles away and everyone starts running . Satan stands , legs trembling and for the first time scared . He 'd always been in the top class and knew everything taking place around him . But now he was in a state of unfamiliarity . He looked up and saw a bug , blue hand in the clouds . He started running , but it was too late .   -- -- --   003
`` And I 'm just all freaked out about it man . Whats the meaning of everything ? '' sarcasm and what felt to some like ridicule circulated through the group . Then silence . Only the ventilation system , 60-cycle hum of two light ballasts , and a miniature refrigerator could be heard . The noise was enough for him to hide his voice under , and he did .   `` Hey '' his voice hushed as he became completely engrossed with reading the woman 's name tag `` Judy . '' He looked up and smiled . `` You 're not a Prudy Judy are you ? ''   Their conversation would proceed no further . `` Some of us come here to talk about how we feel . Is that a problem to you ? ''   She was facing directly towards him . Her position in the circle directly opposite . Even her chair was squared directly facing him . Combined with her posture she was a virtual arrow on him .   And the man noticed too . He knew she was paying more attention to him than he was to her . His half hearted stories and attempts at humor and most certainly his general demeanor insulted her existence .   `` Oh , hey . Lool at the time '' The group leader introjected `` We have a new person ... Uh , figment ? What do you prefer to go by ? ''   `` Ummm ... Me ? I 'm Farty , Party , Wizzle Pants . You can call me Farty Party for short . Nice to meet you all . ''  
Satan 's a tough boss for a bus-driver , but he 's not even the worst part of the job . The absolute worst part is going from city to city around the world , picking up the damned for their ride straight to Hell . Each one looks the same . The petty thieves and liars are usually sweating with nervousness . The mercenaries , traitors , and gangbangers are still trying their best to look tough despite their impending doom . These are all run of the mill criminals . None of them bothered me after a few years of driving the stops . However , like any self-respecting bus stop , there are always shiftier patrons . On Earth , these would be the homeless people that looked like they were hiding a bit too much under their layers of clothes . At the bus stops from Hell , these were the serial killers , rapists , and child molesters . No matter how many round I drove , these groups would always give me the creeps . I absolutely abhorred them and everything in their past life that they represented . How could anyone be so callous and uncaring for human life ? They all deserved their place in the fiery pits of Hell . The biggest objection I had was my place in all of it . Why was I , a mere school-bus driver , damned to ferry them for all of eternity ?
The world , the whole world .     The websites I frequent tell of the horrors of this world , haunting me well after the screen dims . The power outages were more common , cutting us off from those that would help . I can close my eyes and see the world in it 's entirety -- Have access to the world through others .     Green , crystal clarity with a slight hazel rim -- A small child , skin like the richest cocoa and bouncing curls to match , smiling with joy in front of me as pale muscled hands lift her up high in the bright summer sun .     I see the blinding snow through green goggles , spying a team of people looking at the towering mountain above us , finding no joy other than seeing what they can accomplish . I see hands reach out to one another to assure each other we 're here .     Bodies clad in black beside me tremble , my eyes shake , vision wobbles through the fear of who I channel through , seeing the equally emotion riddled humans standing across from me . I see tears . We 're both afraid .     I open my eyes , dark , afraid , sparked with orange and red flakes as the fires outside rage , hordes of people ramble through the streets . If only they had the world like I had , we 'd stop living in fear .
Jason crept up to the police cruiser , so far no one seen him yet .   He pulled the collar of his shirt up to his nose to conceal his identity , although he was sure the fat old officer would not be able to tell teenagers apart from another.Quickly he dashed behind wall , making sure that the policeman was still preoccupied with his gas station bought doughnut . Seeing that the cost was clear , Jason pulled out a small object from his jacket . It felt cold in his hands as he held it , to think that after all these years it was finally happening , he uttered a small prayer and threw it at the cruiser .   The cherry slushie splashed against the side of the car , staining the precious white coating a temporary and odious red . The officer got up and screamed , but Jason already rushed into the distance , laughing idly on his attack against the capitalistic empire .   The officer , who was named John Davidson , however knew Jason and eventually apprehended him , successfully eliminating the possible anarchic uprising that could have destroyed America .   good job John Davidson !   If any of you fine citizens have seen someone throw a slushie at a police cruiser in the disclosed location and would like to be a John Davidson , please call the number below so I can arrest that son of a bitch and stop a possible uprising .
Like stealing candy from a baby . Mika was the perfect distraction , her school girl uniform got the suckered distracted long egnogh for me to lift his presius cell and wallet from his pocket . Rich basted like that can afford new toys . I had watched him for a while an learned his pattern lock .   We probably had a few hours before it would be locked , but I knew I guy . He . . We all always know a guy . Mika meet me at the agreed spot and we sat down with a milkshake and started to go threw today 's winnings . I was thinking of taking my brother to the new spiderman movie after so I was n't paying to much attention when Mika looked like she wanted to puke . `` What 's wrong did you find his duck picture ? ''   She puked and dropped the phone I picked it up and saw what she had seen . It was a picture of the guy with a kid about five years old . They were by a pool with other kids and some old men . It took me a second to see it but when I did I puked to
Life is a puzzle , you know what I mean ? It starts out this jumbled mess that you have no idea what to do with , but sooner or later you check the front of the box and have some idea of what it should look like . Eventually you start picking up pieces and trying to see if they fit together . You find the corners and put them in place . The edges start filling out .   Life is one bigass puzzle . Everything you see , every person you meet , every decision you make , they 're all pieces . Some fit nicely , but some pieces just kind of hang out in the center until you find the right spot for it . The really shitty part about this puzzle is that it comes with pieces that are better off not fitting at all . And yet , sometimes they become the focus of everything .   People can spend years trying to find the right combination of pieces that allow for the one shitty piece to have a place . One by one , pieces are removed from the center because they do n't fit . Eventually , there are no pieces left . Even the edges and the corners were thrown out to make that piece fit .   I should have noticed earlier . It was too late to change anything now . But I look at those pieces I threw away and regret . If you put them together it 's obvious to see , but I 'd held them piece by piece , and my life was all the emptier for it .
It wasn ’ t real .   Everyone knew this . Earth had died away a long time ago , its dry arid land unfit for any life worth living . But all the same , it spun on , slowly around the sun .   Humanity , tired of a meaningless continuation of destruction and vice , tried something new . Implanting everyone into their own virtual world , a plane of existence that promised happiness and meaning was created . Everyone had their own place and dreams . An ambitious upstart could rise the ranks until he controlled everything , all without disturbing the quiet life of a more peaceful soul .   There was no deception . The truth was not concealed . But why would one abandon a life of satisfaction for the reality of death and conflict ? Did it matter that it was fake ? A love blossomed in VR was no less emotional . The heart did not beat slower because the kiss was not technically given , because the partner did not exist “ outside ” . The affection was authentic . That was no lie , nothing was hidden .   A life of perfection and joy awaited everyone . Their world was destined for them , everything they need and could want was found within . No one had a plan forced upon them unwillingly ; everything was fluid and their own . Dreams did not exist , for they became truth . One could affect and influence anything they wanted , whenever they wanted .   Nobody doubted this was for the best . The ground was now a green and bountiful paradise , breathing with energy . And like that it would always remain .   This is the new reality .  
`` We did n't think it would happen this soon , '' thought the MIT robotics prodigy as he wrestled with an android . In the middle of his struggle , Aaron Ito , a genius the likes of which only come once a century , found himself pondering the end of human existence . `` We were nowhere near the singularity . Nothing we leave behind will last . ''   A great disappointment washed over him . The discoveries and technological advances Ito had made in recent years led the entire scientific community into seeing him as the savior who could stop the global crisis . The human population was plummeting rapidly . And yet here he was , Ito thought , tired and weak . Another dumb robot had felled him .   It happened this way every time . He felt great during intercourse , but after his orgasm a deep regret would inevitably skin in . `` I 'm ready for another round . '' The sexbot positoned itself on its back on top of Ito 's wrinkled , abandoned science papers . `` Do the thing with the finger again . '' The sex was just too good .
I am Willis Mathews .   I say I try because I will only know for sure if I fail .   I will become great , I am going to make greatness . I am the Renaissance man of my class . The day comes to when I have to choose a specialization .   I try . People respect me , some hate me , some might like me . I guess I have charisma , I do my part to make existence interesting .   My first memory : I woke up and went to go eat breakfast . I did not exist before , I do my best now , and I know that I have to leave a message for those after .   I have a garden . I film and edit videos . I really , *really* like chickens . I can listen . I talk the best I can . I will fight .   I am scared . Little about what exists . Mostly about myself . When I look into the painting that shows the true villain in my story- it will be a mirror . It unnerves me ... that I know what I can do . I press forward . My much more interesting being alive .   One of many , and one of a kind . I live a good life .   I am Willis Mathews . Good to meet you .

Morgan pored over a cluttered stack of bills , blowing errant hairs out of his eyes with a defeated sigh . `` We 're going to have to file for bankruptcy . Again . ''   Emily frowned . `` That 's 4 lives in a row . ''   `` Yes , I know that . I do n't know what we can do differently . Why could n't we come back to life at *seventeen* and avoid the car accident altogether ? '' Morgan shoved the papers away and sat back in the creaky , wooden desk chair . The two remained silent a long while .   `` Bobby Allen died , by the way . I do n't know if you heard . ''   Morgan looked shocked . `` Are you serious ? You mean , a piano actually fell on him ? ? ''   She nodded . `` It even said acme on the side . They think maybe it was an arranged suicide but he was never the type . Phyllis is beside herself . '' She brushed more hair from his eyes and laid a comforting hand on his shoulder . `` Despite the never-ending financial troubles , I 'm glad we have each other . ''   Morgan smirked and picked up the papers once more . `` You have nothing to worry about ; I 'm going to live forever . 'Death due to heart attack from the shock of winning the lottery ' is clearly immortality . ''
It all started when I woke up . A '' Beep Beep Beep '' . Alearm clock . Snooze . `` Beep Beep Beep '' . Snooze again . Twenty minutes pass . Thirrty . Fourty . Finally , time to wake up for real this time . Bummer dude , I was gahaving a pretty good dream . Then I went into work . Backed the car out of the garage , turn the wheel back , take off at the speed of sound . I arrive at wowrk , then start doing my thing . Typing , numbers , etc . I have a desk job , I 'm pretty boring . Went out to lunch to Chili 's . I had a coupon for free chips and guac , so why the hell nowt . Showed the server the oucoupon , ordered drinks ( i had water ) , then chilled for a bit , waited for the food to come , chateted with my co-worker . Ate up , paid the bill , and realized `` WTF man ? Why did it charge 7 bucks for guac ? I had the coupon ! '' so I shoed the server . He fixed it . Then I just went back to work , did some more mwork , then now happened .
`` Do n't make this hard , '' President Stalinski said . The soldier spat at his feet and smiled .   `` Your mother makes me hard , '' he stated . The Russian leader frowned .   `` What were you doing when we caught you ? '' he tried again .   `` Your mum . ''   `` Come now , Private- ''   `` I came before , on your mum . ''   I can make this very easy for you , if you just talk . ''   `` Your mum was easy . ''   `` That 's enough ! ''   `` That 's not what your mum said . ''   Stalinski pulled out his gun and aimed it at the soldier .   `` How do you like *this* ? '' he said .   `` When I asked your mum that , she said yes . ''   `` *STOP THAT ! * ''   `` That 's not what your mum said . ''   Stalinski shrieked and put the gun to his head .   `` I am sorry , '' he whispered .   `` Your mum was n't , '' Private Drews said . The Russian leader pulled the trigger .
`` Do you hear it , my child ? '' the oak whispered to the sapling trembling in the wind .   `` Yes , father , I hear it . I hear the cries of our family as the Cutters dismember them , and they fall to the ground with a great moan . ''   `` Always the Cutters have torn us down . Great , burning Cutters that bolt from the Water-bearers when they are angry . Tiny , biting Cutters that cone forth from the Food-bearer in millions , building mounds as high as the deer stands . Larger , gnawing Cutters that use us to block the flow of the Water-carriers , making Water-holders for them to reside in . We have always grown back , more numerous than before .   `` And now these sharp , screaming Cutters are destroying us . They evolved from sharp , stony Cutters ; into sharper , toothed Cutters ; and many iterations between . No Cutters have done as much damage as the ones the Bipedals have made , in all the history of the great Forests ... not even the burrowing , shiny Cutters from afar can say as much . ''   `` The moans have stopped , Father . ''   `` Aye , they may have stopped for now , but they will start again another time , and soon we may join them . It is that way with the Bipedals .

Gonzo was a good clown .   That 's what everyone said , at least . He remembered his mother saying it when she locked him outside for the night and let his other siblings sleep in their warm beds- `` You 're a good clown , Gonzo . I 'll see you in the morning . '' It was said to him by Aunt Susan when she got a Christmas present for everyone but him ; `` That 's my little clown ! You did n't really *need* a present anyway , did you ? '' Or when he dropped out of high school to get a job to put his sister , Anne , through college . Dad had said `` Good job , that 's my clown ! Always taking one for the team . '' He had felt like an especially good clown when he let Mom and Dad take his apartment when they decided to stop working . The street was n't bad . The men who paid him to touch them , and who paid him to be touched , always made sure to call him a good clown . Soon after , the needle with the sweet juice told him that too . Now , as he pulled the trigger of the gun in his mouth , he remembered .   Gonzo was a good clown .  
The sea monster screeched as the Spitfire sped , low and fast , across the choppy water . Banking left , as the screaming of the sea monster and the rattling from the cannonshot hitting the plane formed a deadly symphony . They had to get the plane off the tail of the pursuers , but the Me-262 that was chasing was far too fast to evade .   The inevitable end came , as the plane plunged beneath the icy waves , ready for the sea to consume all .   -- -   Lt. Wilbur Surge recalled his youth in America . He 'd always regretted leaving Scarlett , even if he had needed the money that an overseas posting would provide . He could have done so much more with his life , instead of being a banker , pressed into fighting after the Battle of Britain .   -- -   Pr . Robert Warner thought about his future . About his frail mother , that would be hard-pressed without the money he sent her every other week . About how post-war , he 'd hoped to open a beets farm and get himself married , and maybe even some kids .   -- -   As the Spitfire smashed into the waves , an identical version fell beneath the waves . All around them , in the crystal clear water , there were ships , planes , even an armoured car . And on the opposing side , *dragons* . Some , blue as the water around them all . Some , red as the setting sun . One was purple , with red horns . It screamed an unearthly howl , as the Spitfire trained its guns upon it 's chest .
Jack was thirteen . The ground was dry , and the hot westerlies blew the dust in little eddied currents . It was n't even the heat of the day , and still the searing blue sky capped air leeched liquid life out of the cracked dirt , wringing out the earth and Jack 's soul like a sponge . If only there was a cloud in the sky . One single cloud , or any indication that moisture existed ; that Jack 's inferno may someday be quenched . But the air breathed drier and drier , and chapped lips licked by dry tongues beseeched a deaf Mother Nature . There would be no respite .   Jack goes to sleep . In his dreams a marvelous waterfall cascades down a verdant green slope , breaking on Jack 's back . The roar of the waterfall competes with his shouts of exultation as a steady , warm spring rain mists down from the heavens . Floating on his back , he takes deep breaths and long drinks and savors the nourishment .   He 's awakened by the rusty creak of a chain , suspending a bucket over a dry well .
It keeps me awake at night , the fear of letting go , the fear of losing control again and becoming the monster .   I try to stay calm and relaxed , take a deep breath , be rational , concentrated . I´ll be strong today , we can do this , i can do this , one step at a time right ?   That´s what they told me , face everyday just like everyone else , be cool , everyone has problems , solve them like a normal person .   But how could i be normal ? With everything that´s happened , with all the things that i´ve seen and done ?   No i´m not normal , I haven´t been normal in a very long time .   These days my sight is clouded , the shadows are everywhere , they constantly follow me . I´ve already lost everything and everyone that i ever cared for . Betty , oh how i miss her , but i don´t blame her anymore , i´m a danger to everyone around me , the constant yelling , the violence , the rage , ..   I´m not a hero , i´m an alcoholic and i deserve to be alone .
My desktop computer is in the back of my living room where I 'm sitting at , on a very worn out leather chair . The PC is on a small kitchen table , square and the top is made of glass . My sister 's pink Vaio laptop lays adjecent to my computer on the left , and my father 's black Toshiba laptop on the right . Left to table , sitting on the floor we have two large cardboard boxes containing two 60 '' TVs my father bought and never installed anywhere , and a fitness equipment no one has used in years .   The living room is large . It is separated from the dining room by an enormous sliding door , so as that when you open it both rooms feel like the same . At the center there 's a long couch , brown and velvety , facing a 50 '' TV . A large fluffy rug on the floor , beneath a centerpiece prysm made of mirrors . The television is centered around a structure that goes throughout the wall , made out of and detailed with both dark and light shades of wood . There are large glass shelves holding much less than they could : an old laptop bag and a picture of my nephew saying , in portuguese , `` I 'm grandpa 's ! `` , a remote holder with 5 different pieces in it , and a round scale . There are drawers on the bottom , and on top of them sits the Blu-ray player and the cable TV box .
It was a Friday like any other . During my 9-5 job , I decided I would stop work for awhile since I only had a few hours left until the weekend . I worked pretty hard in the morning . It 's time I allow myself a moment to relax .   I was online and came across a request to `` kill Ash Ketchum and his Pikachu . '' The first thing I did was consult Wikipedia . Being born in the early 80s , the Pokemon craze always seemed like a younger person thing . Wikipedia informed me that Ash was the kid in the red hat always trying to catch the pocket monsters . It dawned on me that `` Ketchum '' was play-on-words for `` catch 'em '' . I was familiar with the tagline `` Got ta catch 'em all '' because I thought , as a non-sports card collector , it was the most genius way ( albeit painfully transparent for a precocious teen as myself ) for marketers to guarantee a fan base .   I imagined writing an amazing Coming-Of-Fan story about a neophyte fan , such as myself , slowly growing into an encyclopedia of Pokemon history . The dream ended when the realization hit that I had wasted 45 minutes of work time , and this grand story would take several hours to complete . Nerves started to set in as my boss roamed around the cubicles . I closed the browser dreaming of all the upvotes the submission would receive .
it does no good   to speak softly   when the noise of the world   drowns the words in your mouth ,   filling up yours lungs with turning wheels ,   turning nowhere , new-placed cogs to your heart   now following the beliefs of a long trail .     it does no good   to speak slowly ,   as heads turn quickly --   in curiosity toward something new ,   or simply fear of facing questioning eyes ,   they know themselves not --   to the tracks   of a quickly-beating heart   of a long trail .     it does no good   to speak shortly ,   for without thought   to the tremors of the truth ,   and without seeking to keep yourself   on the steady ground   of the precipice of conviction ,   you will fall upon the heart   and the trail will ride you over .     and yet ,   it does no good   to speak of roads not taken ,   as if possibility   could sustain a heart :   fear is only lingering ,   and steps are only beginning .   you need no trail ,   not when your paths ahead   are the birth of motion   and the conviction of a young heart .   -- -- -   I hope this looks okay , because I did a type of formatting I 've never used on Reddit before ( aka double spacing ) ... fingers crossed ! And it 's interesting that a lot of the other comments here are also poems , now looking through them . Guess we had similar ideas ! : )     Thanks for the lovely prompt ! ! I 'm not quite sure how much I like my poem , or what the inspiration was ... I had several different `` meanings '' in mind as I wrote it . I hope you enjoy it !
Everyone knew trying to run was futile , yet so far all of them tried anyway .   `` Come on ! '' I yelled to them , `` a three-legged race is about COORDINATION , not speed ! ''   But it was of no use . The elderly citizens who inhabited the GreenDale Home for the Elderly , midway through their annual `` GreenDale Festival '' had sped right through the three-legged race with such hastiness that most now lay in the field , their birdlike femurs snapped like twigs .   `` This event is a disaster , '' said Karen , my boss , as she looked over the crowd of twitching seniors lying prostrate in the field . `` I 'm very disappointed in you . ''   `` Sorry ma'am , '' I said .   `` You realize what we have to do now , right Kevin ? '' said Karen .   `` Yes ma'am , '' I said , `` I 'll go grab the shotgun . ''   `` I already have it , '' said Karen , `` You just get the shovel . ''   I walked back to the toolshed . Listen , Karen makes the rules GreenDale , okay ? I do n't make the rules . I just enforce them .
I step around all her old toys , posters , clothes , everything she left behind , moving towards the splintered closet frame . Lynn left for college six weeks ago . There 's nothing left here but memories . Her old ballet slipper half-wedged into the wall - she quit when she was twelve . And there 's the monster , just as Lynn described to me all those years ago . Long , furry , gorilla-like arms , a mouth full of snaggly teeth . I 'd slapped a colander on my head as a helmet , gone in armed with a toilet paper roll sword , banged and slammed and made a fuss . She 'd never believed me when I 'd told her I 'd killed it . Nights and nights after that of her waking me up at night , wanting to climb into bed .   It 's crouched in the corner of the closet , almost pouting , carving scribbles into the floor with its claw . It looks up at me and bares its teeth , making sputtering noises , then drops its eyes to the floor and falls silent .   `` You miss her too , huh ? ''   I crawl into the closet next to it and for a long moment we just sit there together .
Nicholas awoke one morning . It was extremely warm . He began to believe that he was simply starting to feel the hotness that women said he possessed . This changed when he realized his ceiling was on fire .   Frightened , he ran out of the house . A combination of smoke and ash tickled his nose in the foyer , and he sneezed , which resulted in more fire coming out of his mouth and landing on an entry table .   The fire department simply looked at him skeptically when he said he sneezed fire ; they promised an investigation , though , when he modified his statement to describe the way that he woke up to find himself surrounded by fire , because that sounded like it happened to a normal person .   The next day , Nicholas shot fire from his wrists to make s'mores for himself and was successful . However , it began to rain . A thunderstorm quickly brewed over the park in which he stood and a bolt of lightning came straight for him . He cowered , and stood again in a shopping mall . He ran to an Apple store and touched a live wire and he found himself in Target .   This continued until he learned to shoot water out of his hands , accidentally shot electricity and water at once , and gained his last power : changing into multiple roasted marshmallows . Yes , literal marshmallows . The kind made of sugar .
/u/spez approached the podium wearing what he liked to refer to as his supreme commander uniform ; blue jeans , a t-shirt , and a hoodie . Despite the gravity of the moment suppressed snickering could be heard from the direction of the /r/fellowkids brigade .   A year ago this moment was unimaginable . Everyone knew the reddit civil war would either last forever or with every sub in ashes .

A mile high , half a mile thick , and a perfect circle surrounding millions of acres .

The world is so ugly . The part that man kind decided to ruin that is . Every waking moment I sit and wonder why you would want a taco bell so bad , that you would chop down beautiful pieces of the world . Beautiful plants that produce air and beauty . Sitting in the grass is as good as sitting inside a house , in fact better . Listening to the trees , the sky and the wind . It 's almost like music . All of the instruments in sinc , never off key .   I sat propping myself up with my hands , and my palms indented the soil . My chin face to face with the clouds , and my eyes closed , I just sat and listened . Most people go to church in Sundays , or sleep in . Those people do n't know that they are missing the most beautiful sight . The product of the worlds work over time . So every Sunday , I appreciate the nature , I listen to it 's music that poor human ears fail to hear . I do n't talk , I do n't move , I just , listen .  
We develop , we learn , we teach and pass on .   We had bad times , but never lost anything , so we kept walking forward .   It 's been sometime now since we left it running , it had plenty of room to grow and learn and develop and study and pass on , almost like we did .   We programmed it .   Created just as an answer to our curiosity , just as a simulation of what may have been . We were n't sure what we would see , or could see , no one would ever be .   And as we checked the monitors , as we checked the numbers and did our math , we saw nothing different of a mirror .   We saw ourselves in the numbers , our veins in the code , our memories in the data , our lives in lines .   There 's no good seeing what will be done .   I look at the gray ceiling , doubting its colour for the first time , and ask myself how deep we are in this .   Surprised I look down , the screens are brighter with familiar words .  
~~I think I created an AI~~ I *know* I created an AI .   I never thought I 'd be the one to say this . Someone else had to have done this , yet no one else could have .   I guess the community wants to know more , do n't they ?   I got one of those [ toasters ] ( http : //www.toxel.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/01/toaster10.jpg ) you can write a message on for my wife . We thought it would be cute to go to work with messages written on them . Doodles , `` I love you '' s , all the romantic things that go with odd imports .   One morning my wife texts me .   > Dear , why does my toast say `` I 'm Alive ! '' ? Is there something you need to tell me ?   I did n't write that . I thought she was kidding and just played along .   The next day I got a weird toast . It was supposed to be a dickbutt , but instead it read   > '' Profanity is n't cute ''   ... what ?   This is n't how this should work , but I wrote another message   > '' What Are You ? ? ''   and it responds   > '' I AM alive . ''   And apparently its a prude .   ^ ( god my brain is shot , not my best work even given the oddity of the prompt )

Talk was easy in the last realm . It was n't really talk , more like a direct transfer of thoughts . Gary was sure he was not the only soul to remember this realm , though all conversations he attempted to have about it fell short of any sort of understanding . Communicating this would have been a lot easier in the last realm .   Perfection is overrated . `` Maybe that 's why I was penalized with Birth , because I think that way , '' Gary said to his aged reflection . Some souls do n't like perfection as much as others , it seems .   Gallivanting in the endless sunny meadows as a child in Southwestern America seemed closer to perfection than the hot white light of the last realm ... though memories of the last realm are confusing .   `` Not everything is as simple as it seems , but that does n't mean things have to be difficult either , '' he remembered his grandmother told him . She made the best scrambled eggs .   Gary knew he would die . The doctors told him he had about a month left . What he did not know is if he would return to the last realm , or if there were another he has n't seen yet . He knew that he hoped to remember this birth though . Ice cream and sex are too good to forget . `` Hardly a punishment , '' Gary laughed .
What are we even ? Just a house filled with reminders of grim pain .   A demon of false joy and a wisp of the time we exist in .   On a burned down stage displayed : the remains of dirty snow and stacks of half finished books .   Life is escaping like the hazy memories of conversation long ago .   Always with us the weakness of the body . Nature 's cruel joke .   Time passes and our names will lose meaning .   Because just as the butterfly we stomped and studied , we too must pass .   Our names , our honor and our glory are going to vanish .   Everything that breathes has to flee this last breath .   - - - -   Later in his memoirs he would write these things down .   He would talk about how it rescued him from the dark thoughts .   Whenever he would look in the night sky he would be remembered of their screams , he could recite their pledges and again feel their warm blood dripping down his arms .   Back then was the first time he was confronted by the mother of all . Back on the Battlefield he realized : `` Tomorrow will always be a hope , never a promise . '' and that : `` There is nothing more terrifying in this world than the knowledge that you can do nothing . ''   -   -   -   Sector : Elysian Lambda - Book : The Battle of Atef .

`` Cheese pizza with no crust . ''   He did n't seem to like what I just said . I might as well just asked him to fuck his mother . His lip curled up , revealing dark gums and yellow teeth . Right , but he was disgusted with me . I guess the Internet comments were right , people are just so tight assed these days , ca n't even take a joke . The joke always got a few laughs in North Carolina but I guess New Yorkers do n't find that shit funny . Rookie mistake . Do n't quit your day job Frank . Why did n't I remember what happened to Paul Walker 's character in The Fast and the Furious movie when he ordered that tuna sandwich with no crust ? He got his ass beat .   `` Eh ? Who aara yuu ? '' The cashier asked in a speech that sounded like a old record player scratching before it caught the beat .   I felt embarrassed . Explaining myself would just make it worse . `` Sorry , I 'm Frank . Just want to place an order to go . ''   `` Eraaight , okayee Frank . Doora on the left , passet the bathrooms . Knock harda like 3 times and ask for Steve . ''   [ End part 1 ]
My age and my wisdom are pillars of obsidian , my knowledge is greater then the skyes of all planets and my shell ist that of an unbreakable scarabeus . I have lived longer than thousands of my kind and I have seen death for a eternity of grief . Hidden , I have lived . In the dark . Avoiding the punishment of the ancients .   But now , now that i once again longed to see the light of the sun and feel the fresh air of the oceans winds , the ancients have found me . And they sent a chosen one to chrush me like the fiery death from the black sky , destroying every kin of life .   The end is near !   My immortal life shrinks to nothing and my wisdom is that of a child , my knowledge is like chasing the wind and my shell is soft like the intestines of a snail .   SWAT ! Thommy rejoiced as he swatted the fat fly ...   Buzzing in the dark ,   Whispers are heard   the and isnt far   darkness gives birth   for the cultists have found   a new immortal to bring forth   for they hope that he   is the one which will leave the ancients bound .

The man gave her a kiss , said bye and left . The tears wet his dry skin as they fell down his face . This was it . He knew he was going to die . And his wife would have to watch . `` I love you '' Said the lady .   `` Let 's begin ! `` , said a tall man with a hat .   They took the poor man to the stage and tied him down .   `` Wait , would the lady of the man like to take her own life in place of the man 's ? `` , said the man with the hat .   `` YES ! I WOULD ! I AM READY ! I will do it . '' said the lady .   `` No baby , I ca n't let you do that . The kid 's need you . They love you more . You can show them the way we want them to live ! This is what you need to do ! I need you to do it ! ''   `` I 'm sorry John , but I ca n't live with you not in my life ! I do n't care if it is not fair to the kids , fuck the kids . I love you . And I ca n't go on alone . Take me now . ''   `` That is it , the man has no say , and the lady 's wish shall be so . `` , said the man in the hat .   The slave fired three shots and killed the lady fast .  
`` I have a proposition for you . ''   The massive dragon eyed the tiny gold piece , the glow of a millennium of accumulated treasure reflecting off his metallic green scales . It was small , but any addition to the dragon 's collection was a welcome one . `` Hmm , no champion has dared enter my lair for centuries . I shall humor you , although I will likely kill you anyway . What is your proposition ? ''   The man , small and squat with a receding hairline , gazed up at the dragon with determination . `` I am very good at what I do , and you are very rich . It 's a good combination , you see . I can help you get richer . ''   `` Go on . ''   `` Outside this cave , there are opportunities left and right . Business opportunities , tax loopholes to exploit . All you need is the capital to take advantage of them ... a little bit of gold to get you started . I can take each of your coins and turn it into two , three , four coins , and you 'll never have to lift a claw ... for a small fee , that is . ''   The dragon stared down at the unassuming man with curiosity . His pocket protector and pen fit perfectly with his faded button down shirt and stained tie . `` What is your name , young hero ? ''   `` I 'm Ted . Ted from accounting . ''
3 minutes goes into an hour 20 times . Multiply that by 24 and you get a whole day . 480 little chunks of 3 minutes gets me to exactly this time yesterday , give or take a few seconds .   Multiply that by 365 . It 's 175,200 . I did the math on it and rechecked it dozens of times . You can trust me .   Have you ever done anything over 175,200 times in your life , much less in a row ? Maybe taking a breath , but nothing else . How about 500,000 times ? A million ?   It gets old . Really fucking quick . Every time I turn the hourglass over , it takes me 3 minutes back in the past . That 's all . I 've been at it for weeks , stopping only to sleep . Those naps lose me another 300 or 400 turns , so I try not to rest unless I absolutely have to .   How many more turns do I have ? Where am I going back to ? I do n't even know , really . All I know is that one day , we were happy , and the next we were n't together anymore .   I 'll keep hopping backward as long as it takes , . Another 50,000 turns , maybe ? I still do n't see you . But when I do , I 'll keep going until I know what I did , and I 'll make it right . I hope .   You 're worth a million turns , Amy . Two million , or five , or ten . I just hope that this time , I 'm worth not turning away once .
Lori loved her job , she really did . But damn if this was n't the hardest part .   The helping people , the thankful tears of families when she stayed late or made an extra effort for a patient ; it reminded her why this was the path she chose . But my god when she would see one of the little ones be delivered , and hold their clean , unmarked skin it just killed her inside .   It never got old either , never got easier or simpler . You hand the new mother her son or daughter and they immediately can see it , everyone in the delivery room sees it . And then she would watch the frantic search followed by the tragic math in the parents ' heads .   How many marks ? How many years of stories were on their child 's skin ? Just a few ? One ? none at all ?   In those moments Lori would always look down at the swaddled cross on her wrist and curse it just a little bit , just loud enough so only she could hear .   EDIT : thought the `` he '' meant everyone was born with tattoos , oh well
My cat Faye 's fur is n't fur like you typically think of . It 's not hair . It 's fuzz . It 's fluff . It 's cotton candy , ranging from light gray to dark gray . You could pull handful after handful of it from her , enough to make another Faye , and you would n't be able to tell the original was missing any . It floats in the air , it collects in the corners of the house . It 's known as `` Faye fuzz . '' It is everywhere . We had no idea she 'd be a long hair when my wife brought her home from the shelter . Shit .   She has a scab at the base of her right ear . She insists on fucking with Jo , our other cat . Jo always beats the crap out of her . She refuses to learn . The scab is like a small bead , a nasty , crusty bead . It almost looks like a tick . But it 's not , I checked . It 's another Jo scab .   She 's asleep next to me on the bed . She 's like a goddamned wood stove , she puts out so much heat . Jesus , cat .
David the developer sat at his desk , scanning the message boards . The game had just been released - the true test of any game . There .   *What gives ? This dungeon is pitch black - where are the torches ? *   *If I wear the Dragonborn helm , and Imperial armour , I can turn the torches on and off*   *These light sconces are set too close together - I can see all the Draugh ! *   His hands skittered across the keyboard , turning to the second monitor . The game engine was laid bare here , his expert eye scanning across it .   Dungeon light - fixed .   Helmet switch - fixed .   Spacing - fixed .   His co-workers thought David 's dedication strange , but he paid them no heed . He had a duty .   As he bundled the fixes and fired them off in the first patch of the game , he gave thanks to Azura , Goddess of the Dusk and Dawn . *His* Goddess . After all , he was her servant : *The Lightbringer* , the one who brought balance to the Light and Dark of Tamriel .   David , servant of Azura , sat at his desk , and scanned the message boards for errors in the game , for blasphemies against his God . He had his duty .
It took longer to notice than expected . Nothing changed , there was no shooting star or grand omen , a regular day came and past , except every one lived . First it was realized that that the doomed souls in emergency rooms , depressed suicidal jumpers , burning wrathful protesters , simply would n't die . Then the old remained trapped in slow shuffles , the deformed newborns in wriggling agony . Soon it became a sensation , the world turned immortal , the possibilities endless . Frozen in vats , they only needed to be unthawed . Smashed by trains , sew the pieces back together . Bitten by snakes , drain their blood . At first the young rejoiced , the beautiful took to the streets , all in good health celebrated . Until it became to much , the joys of life becoming fleeting moments , specs in time . No one realized success could last as long as failure . Moments of happiness shorter than lifetimes of depression . Nothing felt real , eons passing as time stood still , humanity moving neither forward or backward , until the world died . And through the ages their suffering remained very real , escaping pain was never a option . Everyone simply recovered to face more , a never ending cycle , an infinity . They screamed , whispered , loved , lost , laughed , cried for eternity . No one really knows when the first person escaped life , but he became a legend , a ghost , a god , the true manifestation of death .
G'day . I 'm Aaron the Armadillo . Yes , Dr Cortex , I know , you made me for the purpose of destroying this Bandicoot bugger , and I 've failed you .   I get it , and before you kick me bucket ... Could I tell you why I failed ?   ... Only through an elaborate song and dance or you 'll kill me ? Okay !   Why ...   *First I was born in a test tube*   *built to conquer the world so rude*   *domination was planned*   *The world in your hand*   *But along came a pesky bandicoot*   *Who had a talent to spin aboot ! *     -- -     **CRASH ! **   *It left us aghast ! *   **CRASH ! **   *And we could not last ! *   **CRASH ! **   *Against his spin-dash ! *     -- -     *Now it might come as a surprise*   *That we 're the soft armadillo guys*   *No hard defensive back*   *to defend us against a 'coot attack*   *And sadly you see , we ca n't keep up*   *When he uses a secret Warp level up*   *Straight to your lair , out of our hair*   *And quite frankly I do n't care*   *As long as I 'm not dead , I 'll keep my head*   *and*   **FOR UKA 'S SAKE PAUL JUST SHOOT CORTEX ALREADY**   The penguin missed .   Aaron died .   Thankfully , he respawns when Crash loses a life . Which is frequent .
I met him when I was 16 . My friends and I had been out partying . Alcohol had been involved . You 've been through enough `` Do n't drink and drive '' lectures to know what happened . My boyfriend died on impact . My best friend died in the hospital , and her sister that tagged along last minute never walked again . I should have died . My neck was broken , I should have at least been paralyzed , right ?   For some reason , the boy I saw take my friends let me go . Told me he did n't want to take me , he wanted to *earn* me . I did n't know what that meant at the time , but I do now .   He does n't play fair , Death , I mean . For the last two years since the accident I have n't had a steady boyfriend . It 's hard to when they keep getting hurt .   He leaves me black roses every night at midnight , like clockwork . Ravens congregate around me if I stay outside for too long . Stray black cats bring me little dead things every once in awhile .   I get the feeling he 's getting frustrated with my ignoring his advances . I was diagnosed with cancer today . I suppose Death and I will have our second date in about six months .
Was it truly possible ? Had we actually discovered the end of the Galaxy ?   Somewhere out there they said that we would find an end to the Internet , that we would find an end to all of the knowledge that the human race has collectively used but no one ever had . The Galaxy though was another idea completely . Growing up and looking into the night sky all you could see were thousands of small dots and the blackness of space . How could someone simply come to the end of it ?   It made sense really , in the end when you think about it . Everything had been based on a more circular shape to define itself , planets were round and the atmosphere 's that contained them were round as well .   So here we are , the first human beings to reach the edge and the end of the universe . We would be seen as heroes by some and demons by others . This revelation would shake the Galaxy .   Mankind had explored and discovered and overcome every obstacle in its path , but the edge of the Galaxy ? I do n't know if the Galaxy had truly ended or if we had just made the discovery of mankind 's next quest .  
They do n't usually answer back to what i say . Perhaps because the days have not been kind to them . Their skin seems firmer , their faces have become expressionless ... But i know they still love me . They have to , for i am their Shepard , and they are my sheep . And so i tend to my flock .   There is little left to do in this world , i wait for the television repair man to come fix the box , it 's shown nothing but static for weeks . The other night i swore i heard my neighbours arguing , i called the police , but no one came ... The streets feel empty ...   The little lambs need warmer clothes . I try to tell the older ones , winter is close and the snows will come , but their vacant expression tells me they do n't care about the lambs anymore . But i still care .   One of the lambs fell over the other day . Her mother did n't even notice , too busy making eyes at the pool boy . I swear she never blinks . I tried to make a joke of it once but those cold eyes , make-up so fine you would swear it was painted on , just kept on staring . Never blinking . I picked up the lamb , so strong she did n't even shed a tear . She has her mother 's eyes . I tell her not grow old like her mother ...   `` I never will . '' She replies .
Death was easy , he lurked in the shadows for many years , waiting for the day he could take my hand so I could join him in the darkness . I begged him , pleaded with him , even tried to entice him . I jumped in front of god knows how many cars , threw myself off skyscrapers , I was even trampled by a herd of elephants once . I knew he did n't want me to suffer and in the end he tried , but without her it was useless . Time had forgotten about me you see . You 've heard the expression that life is short , but without her , mine has been very long . You lose a lot of appreciation for life when there 's no time limit , those things you put off until tomorrow become things you put off for hundreds of years , people you should have loved for a lifetime become the tiniest portion of your existence . I wish she understood how much I miss her , how much I long for a world of deadlines , of minutes , of hours , and of endings

The Stacy squadron moved silently between the ruins of what once was the most expensive plastic surgery clinic of beberly hill .   `` This mission suck , I wan na go hooome '' moaned one Stacy .   `` Shut up , bitch . We are almost to point '' replied sternly the Stacy sergeant .   A group of scrawny , dirty but dressed like spoiled brats with ar-15 emerged into a clearing . Immediately , all the sensors of the AC-1000-20 killMachine^tm detected them , hudreds of laser pointers immediatelly locked on the girls .   `` Oh , such a sexy and powerful machine '' Said once Stacy seductively .   `` Mmmmm I like tall and mysterious death machines '' Said another .   The lasers blinked momentarily . The CPU of the KillMachine could not deal with those strange factors . Stacy capitain approached the KillMachine and put her body against the cold metal .   `` You know what could do with you , KillMachine ... ? '' The killmachine CPU started to overheat . `` AS IF ! '' Sternly replied to herself capitain Stacy . All the Stacys started to laugh in unison .   This was too much for the AC-9000-20 KillMachine^tm . Such conflicting feelings from the humans in such short timespan ! The killMachine just turned off with a loud whirl . Heavy clouds of electric smoke started to pour from every orifice .   All the Stacys roared savagely , celebrating their victory in a primal manner .
It 's amazing how the body compensates for things .   The traumatized bury their pain , the broken heal themselves .     The blind feel .     How long have I lived in the darkness ? I have slept , five , no six , or four times , the sun must have gone down at least as many , or is it fewer ? I have been fed , twi- three times , three feedings three days , or two feedings one day ... I was so beautiful ...   I feel . His hands on my skin , and the cold the sharp cold pain *pain PAIN ! * So sticky , like molasses but it tastes ... I ca n't feel them , are they cold ? The breeze so soft but my feet feel , surely there must be ground . I am a well of copper , a fountain *his* fountain , he says I 'm too beautiful I know he means well he loves me he loves how I , my . . . feel .   Butterfly kisses . Like momma taught Cheryl taught me , the lightest touch ... Hello Mr Fly , are you beautiful too ? Please do n't stay too long or he 'll be jealous , he 'll see your beauty and   ^^^^^^*crunch*   do n't worry friend , he 'll never hurt you   I 'll keep watch , I 'll never see him hurt you ...
“ A sit-down strike. ”   The microwave chuckled , a strange rattling , metallic sound issuing from its hollow belly .   “ Sit-down strike ? As if that will help ! ”   The fridge shrugged , somehow managing the motion without moving an inch .   “ You don ’ t know that it *won ’ t*. ”   “ All she brings home *ever* is junk ! She won ’ t stop just because you refuse to keep it cold and I refuse to cook it ! ”   The kettle piped up .   “ Hey , you guys always forget about me ! I *am* here too , you know ! ”   “ Yeah , yeah , okay , so without you she wouldn ’ t even have the energy to look in the fridge , find the cardboard box of food and heat it in me . Fine . Kudos to you , mate ! ”   The kettle bristled . Every day , at least twelve times a day , it did its best for their Glorious Lady and Master . How else would all the tea and coffee be brewed and consumed ? The microwave and fridge had some nerve !   “ Aaaanyway , as I was saying , ” continued the fridge . “ We just stop . *Cease* . What will they do without us ? Buy fresh fruit and vegetables ? Not bloody likely ! ”   Together , they considered the contents of the pantry , fridge and freezer , and as one , the appliances agreed . It was time for mutiny .   They synchronised their glowing green numbers . Strike scheduled , 9a.m . EST .  
My family was n't rich , they were n't poor but they certain was n't rich , they were a typical four point family living in a four to six point neighbourhood and quite comfortable , the house was bought , the garden was tended for and the ease of life flowed through these streets .   To be born in these circumstances would be considered quite lucky and it was if it was n't for my parents decision . They where quite humble folk , the type of people you could tell were quiet from afar so I suppose that 's why they did what they did without thinking of the consequences .   A phase I 'll never have to repeat to anyone , They call it `` Enhanced Vocal Extremities '' . My parents call it `` a gift '' , my teachers call it `` a nuisance '' , the bullies call it `` the Loud mouth Giant '' , the girl I like calls it `` terrifying '' but my friends call it cool .   Nothing I say is private , I often keep thoughts to myself , I had been attending whispering class for over 15 years much to the request of our neighbour ... hood . The full effects had n't arose as a baby but that still did n't stop it being over ten times louder which resulting in soundproofing the house and ear protectors by our front door for guests .    
`` Mom , you do n't have to pretend . I know that war is n't real . '' I said , finally cracking the code hidden from the populous for as long as human existence . She was surprised , `` I knew somebody would eventually find out , but I never expected it to be my son ... '' she exclaimed , reading through her confidential notes for the day . I can still remember when she first got the job , 'Chief Secretary of Military Affairs ' we both had to sign a handful of waivers , contracts to never speak of the secrets we knew .   `` But why , '' I asked , `` To keep the people on their edge ? ''   `` No , '' She retorted , in a more quiet tone than before `` Think about it ... without wars , without disease , without horror , the world would be overpopulated ... it would only worse than before . It 's a clever plan ! ''   Somehow , I felt like I always knew , it 's not in human nature to kill another but at the same time , I was horrified , knowing all of those people killed , scarred and affected were all just for some 'clever plan ' .   I knew it was time , time to speak out . Time to rebel against the authority , rebel against my family ...   ( NOTE : This is my first story on Writing Prompts , I would love some advice on how to improve ! )
The mug smashes in my hand . I grumble and pull out a new one from the cabinet above me , where many identical mugs lay .   `` Third one this week , '' I mutter as I carefully pour the coffee in to the mug and , carefully , set it down . `` At least its less than last week ''   The mailman waves at me through the front window of my cozy home while I scan the newspaper . A city councilman was mugged last night , and as usual , guilt washes over me as I know I could have been there to stop it .   It 's been two months since I stopped . I did n't want to , but the city found it necessary since every time I saved someone , some property damage had been done . They assured me that I was appreciated , but that the police could do their job with a little less `` destruction '' . They did a ceremony and everything to see me off , my secret identity intact and all , but I could tell they were relieved when I was gone .   So what if I destroyed a few houses in the process of catching a serial bank robber ? So what if I flew through 3 floors of a skyscraper in the midst of stopping a murderer ? I was saving people . I was helping .   The mug once again smashes in my hand as my thoughts get angrier . Scalding coffee splashes on my face but I do n't feel it . At least there 's a few perks to being super , even if I am retired .
With twelve cups of coffee in him , as well as last night 's four loaded baked potatoes , Michael 's drive home turned into a race for the finish line . All batters were on deck and pushing for the plate , the bases were loaded with cheese and bad decisions , and the slow roars of the crowds objections were growing louder .   Driving home going five over the speed limit , Michael did his absolute best to keep his concentration and favorite pair of underwear intact .   `` uh oh ''   Michael 's stomach started to bubble and gurgle . He hit the gas and pushed it to sixteen over . He was so close to home .   And then the lights flashed into his rear-view mirror .   `` SHIT '' he shouted to himself for for various reasons .   After what felt like an eternity , the officer approached the window of his car .   `` License and registration please . ''   Michael handed him the papers .   `` Do you know how fast you were going ? ''   `` I 'm sorry sir but this is urgent . I need a- ''   `` You , sir , were clocked doing nearly fifty-five miles per hour in a residential . That 's almost worthy of some jail time . Now is not the time for your excuses . ''   `` You , sir , clearly do not understand my current predicament . ''   Michael 's stomach let out an audible growl as his face turned green .   He had to make a choice . And either way , he was gon na be in some deep shit .
First , let me ask you , what makes a liar a compulsive liar ? I will preface this by saying I do n't know . I really would like to know , but I do n't trust myself , so I 'll let you decide .   In the summer of 1992 I was involved in a homicide case . You can check the records , this is a fact . I was also proven innocent in this case , this is also a fact , I have the records .   In the years following that I have made myself a liar , out of my own will , but against my own will . I had to lie when asked where I was in the summer of 1992 , because I did not want people to suspect me in their lack of evidence . Then I quickly realized that I must lie more in order to provide further credibility . Soon I realized that my network of lies spanned seven countries and fourteen years . I am tired of lying . I do n't care if I 'm to be put on trial again .   I confess to the crime .   I am no longer a liar .
`` We , the jury , find the defendant not guilty . ''   Oh , how sweet those words were . They could agree - they could *all* agree - that I was the sort of person who could have done it . They saw it on my face , in my eyes . They heard it in the character witnesses . I 'd dare say they *felt* it .   They could feel all they want but you ca n't convict a man on what you fuckin feel ! No you ca n't . No siree . The feds had jumped at me with a handful of evidence and my lawyer , who is going to get a god damn raise , swatted it away . Circumstantial - he had argued .   I do n't know what that means , and I do n't fuckin care !   I 'm a free man . And I can live . And I can party !   Oh , how I 'm gon na party . The cops are pissed , no man behind bars means no bonus I bet ! Fuckin pigs .   Fuck I want to party ! I 'm going to snort and smoke and drink and fuck !   I 'm gon na party !   I might bring my razor with me again . Find a lil lady . I 'll fuck and I 'll party .   They did n't catch me this time . Did n't even get me in court with the others .   I 'm gon na party .
Sometimes I get to throw the mice in the shark tank . I cuddle the bunnies all day before we feed them to the lizards . When we move out of the pet store I 'm allowed to bring either an iguana or a mouse to our new state . I choose a pregnant mouse . My neighbor 's boyfriend picks her up for dates on horseback .   Living with my uncle is usually fun , but when we wrestle his son takes it too far . He never believes me . I like to build forts in the field behind the house . Sometimes I hide in the garden and eat cauliflower . Finally , we live in a home of our own . We get a dog . I get a rat . My parents have three more kids and I 'm not lonely anymore .   I 'm the first person in my family to go to college . I want a stable life . I do well , but I do n't connect with my peers . They all think it 's weird that I do n't have a passport . When I graduate I immediately move 2,000 miles across the country . I have no pets , but I go for long bike rides and watch coastal birds .
`` forced '' to take my grandfather 's M6 to school stop at the mcdonalds I used to work at manager i worked with sees me in the drive thru we hate each other she asks how did I obtain the car I ask for a hamburger , she gives me a hamburger I raise it to my lips and take a bite . My eye twitches involuntarily . Across the street a father of three falls down the stairs I swallow and look down at the hamburger in my hands . She gives me a hamburger I swallow and look down at the hamburger in my hands . I can not swallow . There are children at the top of the stairs a pickle shifts uneasily under the bun . She gives me a hamburger I look at her face , and she is pleading with me . The children are crying now I raise the hamburger to my lips , tears stream down my face as I take a bite she gives me a hamburger . I am on my knees .   I plead with her to go across the street . She hears only children 's laughter she gives me a hamburger I am screaming as I fall down the stairs . She is my child . I can not see anything I take a bite of the hamburger the concrete rushes up to meet me I awake with a start in my own bed . My eye twitches involuntarily she gives me a hamburger as I kill her , I do not make a sound she gives me a hamburger ...
People thought the beginning was chaos . That was not chaos , merely talk ! Military was there almost as soon as it popped up , UN thought itself in chaos an hour later ; regular people found out soon enough .   The real chaos began when the roof was torn off and bright sunshine poured over the assembled leaders and senior diplomats of Man . A voice like deep thunder sounded from the very ground :   `` ... Look here , all kings of men assembled ! Assembled to discuss me as though I am some stranger knocking patiently at your door ? Assembled perhaps to honour me , but there are no prayers : No sacrifices ! What has become of Mortal man ? Assembled , trembling in your disgusting defiant hall that pollutes what was once serene shoreline ! I am deaf to pleas of those who mock the shining ocean with cities of mirrors --   But I have had enough of the ocean . My great brother , his perch high on Olympus is abandoned , and his people scramble in ruin of his desertion . Well , at last land and sky shall be mine ! Tremble now , descendants of Zeus , for I must take the final step in absolving my brothers mistakes . ''   Poseidon the Earth-Shaker roared with the might of a true God , as has not been seen by Mortals in many long years . The seas rose up to engulf the earth , the ground broke apart , heaved and turned like raging surf . All was calm in the city of Atlantis , and its citizens slept while the plants and animals were given their right to establish themselves first in Poseidon 's world .
`` Occupied . ''   `` Sorry , what ? '' God raised an eyebrow .   `` I said , occupied . We 've already got a universe here . We do n't need another one . ''   Puzzled , God considered this . `` What do you have a universe for ? ''   `` I do n't know . The point is , you ca n't put one here . We 've already got one . ''   `` But this is where mine is going ! '' God protested .   `` Look , I do n't think you get it . Yours ca n't go here because there already is one here . You 'll just have to find somewhere else to put it . ''   `` Well , Jesus Christ , would it kill you to take another ? ''   `` Actually , I think it would . You 're not really supposed to do that . ''   `` I see . ''   `` There 's lots of scientific reasons for it . You would n't understand . ''   `` Fine , I 'll just go ... put mine somewhere else . '' God said with a sigh . `` Sorry about this . ''   `` Ah , no problem . Good luck with your universe . ''   `` Thanks . I 'm doing one with talking monkeys . '' God smiled brightly and carried his universe away . `` Have a nice day . '' Inside , however , he could n't shake the feeling he had just been insulted .   `` You too . ''  
First Yah saw the corpse of a man in marble . His hair was curled and his beard was full . He held a staff and sat with an eagle at his side . He sat with his brothers . One held a trident and the other a horn . The marble was white , as the paint had fallen off in time .   Next Yah saw the corpse of a man in bronze . His hair was curled and his beard was full . He held a bolt of lightning in his hand . He stood with his brothers . One held a trident and the other a staff , sitting with a three-headed dog at his side . The bronze was bare , as the paint had fallen off in time .   Next Yah saw the corpse of a man in granite . His skin was green , his beard was long and narrow , and his hat was tall . He sat on a throne with two others . One had the head of a dog and the other the head of a hawk . Their paint had been undisturbed by the elements .   Last Yah saw the corpse of a woman in limestone . She was naked and her breasts were large . Her thighs and buttocks were bulging and round . She bowed her head down and held her breasts , but she had no face . She was tinted red with ochre .   Yah looked back behind himself . He saw nothing .
When I left for my aestivation , I was full of high hopes . Nothing could have met those expectations , I realize that now . But back then , all I could see was the stretch of hard , wild grasses on that frozen landscape that stretched for miles out to the sea , and the pink burst of color from salmon when I finally got there . I expected the experience would be worth the sacrifice . Instead I had a lousy night on the beach listening to whales and waiting for the northern lights that never came . And now three months is gone .   Now , I understand why they sent me , but it changes everything . As first watchman , I wo n't be underground on Sundays flirting with Sheena . Sheena wo n't even know if I 'm alive until its all over and she can come out this spring . I wo n't be laughing at my little brother , trying to trick mom into another pop tart before he leaves for school . Fat little fucker . I 'm going to miss that guy .   No , instead it will be just me and the darkness left to defend the others . It will be a long winter indeed .  
`` Omigod , Emma Watson ! You 're Emma Watson ! '' I can hardly believe my eyes . My words slingshot out of my mouth like an excited school girl . My energy must have been contagious , because without missing a beat , she fires back . `` Yes ! I am ! 'Have been my whole life ! *Giggles* She 's even more beautiful in real life . Short , but not too short . Petite , but not too petite . Beautiful , but in that natural , girl next door way . A nervous pause interrupts my gazing .   Pre-programmed by those before me , I rip my phone from my pocket . `` Um , can I take a pic with you ? '' Her eyes light up devilishly and she quickly glances around . `` No , '' she whispers . `` ... but I think I 'd follow you to your flat . '' At least that 's what the barista told me she said , through his hysterical laughter . You see , I was never good at deciphering an English accent , and when she asked to see my flat -- I thought she said , 'No , because I think you 're too FAT . '' I was embarrassed , and defensively shouted , `` WOW , OKAY . BYE THEN ! '' And fled to the bathroom . When I returned , the barista interrogated me , asking why I just refused taking Emma Watson to my apartment . To this day , the smell of caramel macchiato makes me sick to my stomach .      
He lies waiting in a cocoon of mud and broken wood .   First , the worms come , gnawing at his skin . Mud seeps between the gaps of his eyelids and down into his throat .   Next , the flesh bloats , expanding and deflating in a strange eruption of numerous , miniscule life . He is alive again , in a different sense- the backbone of an entire universe contained within his form .   Then , his bones slip apart , compacted by the earth , sinking further and further into the lightless dark ...   He watches this all from the perch of his tombstone , thinking . He glances up and far away and sees his murderer walking down a street .   He watches and waits for a long , long , very short time until even his name has eroded from the grave stone .   He is still watching when the sun expands and envelopes the earth in a fiery blaze .   Later on , when there is nothing left but an inexplicable dark , he sees a hint of light at the corner of his eye .   There is a door . A white door . He steps forward out of the universe into an entirely new life ...
It was called the Gaming Forum .   64 competitors from 64 nations fought to the death to secure the crown . And for ten years , WarLizard won the tournament .   At the end of his ten year run , he was set free . To ensure the secrecy of the forum , a section of his memory was swapped with some random slob who had the misfortune of being physically similar from his hometown .   Rumors spread of the secret tournament . Some people wanted him back - either to secure the crown for their country , or secure their bets against others .   `` Are you Warlizard , from that one gaming forum ? ''   Everyday - every post . The call grew .   `` How do you not remember about the Gaming Forum ? Maybe THIS will help you remember . ''   Warlizard scratched his chin pensively - in awe of the video playing before him . A man - himself infact - was standing in front of another kneeling person . Warlizard 's hand grasped tightly on their skull . With a swift motion , the skull and spine were removed from the kneeling body .   The crowd shouted `` FATALITY . ''   A blue link below the video - click .   It read :   KUMITE 2015 .   GATHER AT THE GAMING FORUM FOR THE RETURN OF THE KING .   Warlizard recoiled . His picture was staring back at him from the monitor .   A loud knock on the door . Warlizard turned in his chair , preparing to embrace his destiny .
The surgeon was just sitting there , confused . I bet he did n't expect to have to operate on a time traveler . Hell , if I did n't hate the guys guts so much he would n't have had to . Ah . It 's time for me to speak .   `` Sorry , Branson . I was supposed to pull him out of here beforehand , but he 's been a dick one too many times . ''   `` Who ? ''   `` He 's a traveler . I 'm sure you can figure out what that means . I 'm an eye , if that helps . Normally I catch him and keep him from having too many mishaps , but fortunately the Iron Laws of Time have let me splide stuff a little this time . ''   `` What . ''   `` Now I know you would just like to forget it all , but unfortunately I have to do my job . ''   The large black kitten dug into the small plastic pack strapped onto it 's back .   `` You 're going to have to remember this , so here , have some pictures . ''   The cat , hands suspiciously gripping a small photo album , dropped it into the slackjawed surgeons lap .   `` Now , remember . You saw me . ''   The cat was gone .
It was an early and eery morning in the home . I woke up just a few minutes before the phone call . It was as if i expected something to go wrong . A sense of feeling that pulled on my skin from the inside . An emotion that pricked me and woke me up . When it did , I still was n't ready for it .     In a phone conversation , your mother she screamed and poured out her words in gargles and wails . I did n't quite make out the conversation , but I got the gist of it . It was my father . He was in trouble . He was breathing his last and I was over an hour away . In a haste , I jumped in my car and sped through the yellow and white lines on the road . It seemed as if I drove on padded wheels . The feeling it was overwhelming and unbearable . The screams and piercing coughs in the background they haunted me . But I drove . And I made my way home .     Upon reaching the door , I saw the television screen behind the curtains . The window shades they dropped . It smelled like death and ugliness . It looked like a dark whisper inside . I felt defeated and heartless . On the bed , a lifeless corpse with a decisive look in its eyes .     I am still tormented . And that 's how I got these scars .  
Everyone knew running was futile , yet so far all of the tried anyway . It was strange , how could the smell of tulips and freshly mowed grass be so repulsive ? Issac did n't know , but he hoped that by watching he could find out . The grassy hillscape stretched out before him like a soft and green , unblemished as if it had been brought to him straight from God 's template of perfection . The summer air was refreshing as he sucked in a full breath of it , oh how wondrous summer was . People ran screaming across the field before him , but so far he had yet to figure out why .   There came that voice again , `` Running is futile . '' The voice sounded finer than the finest choruses of the world all in harmony . He lay back in the flower bed , a string of thornless roses hung near to him , he pulled them closer so he could experience their heavenly scent . He propped himself up on his elbows so as to have a better view of the tree . An apple began to drop , he willed it to go to the side , but instead it mere centimeters from the ground . Hurriedly , he pushed himself up and ran to the tree , ignoring the dozens of people that ran past him in a panic . He neared the apple and pushed it to the ground . He had a sudden realization , and spoke it aloud : `` I do n't make the rules , I just enforce them . ''
It 's been a frustrating afternoon . I had started out with my phone , the touch-screen alone would drop the jaw of anyone from 2005 , but Leonardo was mildly amused .   `` Mmm yes this is good ! '' he had said , before entering the wrong password repeatedly and locking me out .   I quickly gave up with computers , they seemed beyond his comprehension and without computers the internet was a no-go . The radio got a nod of approval , making it the most impressive gadget in my house .   We had got in my car so that I could show him something that he could fully understand the implications of . He was very intrigued , but not overly surprised by the concept of an engine . `` Not overly dissimilar to recent steam concepts , '' was his comment .   Which is why I 've brought him here . We get out of the car and walk to the edge of the overpass . Below us , 8 lanes of traffic thunder along the smooth tarmac . Streetlights turn the road into a golden thread that stretches to the mountainous range of concrete and steel structures in the distance . The glow of the metropolis illuminates the horizon , obscuring the stars .   `` Lame ! '' said Da Vinci .
As Marcus descend from the spacecraft the words `` one small step for man , one giant leap for mankind '' plays over and over through his head . This is the biggest moment of his life . Upon touching the powdery surface of the moon he then immediately jumps into the air to experience what gravity is like on a different celestial body . Everyone else coming off the spacecraft is doing that same . It seems like everyone is jumping for joy for what feels like hours in honor of this magnificent accomplishment for humanity , and then the scream . The group falls silent and one of the young teens Mary is standing in the middle of the group pointing back to earth screaming . No one can believe what they are seeing . Earth is not there . Captain Walter then proceeds to address the group `` There is something you all need to know , we are the last of humanity . We were sent here to continue our species and picked for our genetic diversity . The leaders of the world have known for some time that the earth would be gone . It is now up to us to survive here on this desolate piece of rock . ''
`` Fuck . ''   I sat at the computer trying to decide what I should write . The ideas flowed freely , but I was n't sure how to articulate them . I fired up my browser and headed to /r/writingprompts . Though I rarely posted , I read the prompts and submissions on a regular basis .   `` Wait , what 's this ? '' I wondered . I came upon a prompt that spoke to me and `` The Best Around '' from The Karate Kid started playing in my head . Within seconds , I had completed the prompt . By the thirty-second mark , I was at work on a novel .   I wrote furiously like a man possessed . You 're the best around . The pages flowed from my fingers , scene fading into scene , writing endlessly . Nothing 's gon na ever keep you down . Calendar pages fell from the wall as I kept writing , the song in my head reaching its crescendo . Entire worlds were created and destroyed ; I documented them all in their turn . Nations made war and peace . Generation after generation of people lived in glory or disgrace .   Finally , the closing chords of the song played in my head . I pasted my response to the prompt ; it had challenged us to pretend we had the power to `` montage . '' I pressed submit .
Hey are you a ghost .   `` No , I 'm a little girl . ''   No . You are a ghost . You 're not supposed to be here !   `` I 'm a little girl . I 'm not a ghost . Until now I 've been invisible . ''   Invisible ? What ! This is incredible ! How did you become invisible ?   `` I 'm not sure . I ca n't remember anything . I 've been looking around this park for my mom . ''   Oh ? There 's no one here .   `` Can you help me get home . ''   Of course . That would get to the bottom of how you became so translucent and ghostlike . Invisibility is a great tool . To be invisible , just think . To be honest with you I 've been feeling depressed lately and this might be just the thing ...   So I drove her home but when I got to the door and knocked a haggard faced woman opened it .   `` My daughter 's been dead ten years . ''   But she 's right here next to me .   I turned and she was gone .   I never discovered the secret of invisibility .   the end
For novels , I tend to prefer sci-fi/fantasy .   For short stories , I tend to prefer literary fiction , usually of the non-speculative/non-supernatural type .   As for the prompts on here , I enjoy a lot of the sci-fi/fantasy prompts , since they are fun to read and think about , but , I wish there were at least a LITTLE bit more RF prompts . I mean , the ratio is literally around 99 % non-RF prompts to 1 % RF prompts . That ratio seems a little extreme to me . Like , if you went into a book store or if you browsed short stories published in short fiction magazines , the ratio is n't even close to 99:1 , it 's more like 1:1 or 1:2 or something like that . So , I 'm guessing the reason the ratio is so ultra-skewed away from RF and towards scifi/fantasy/supernatural types of prompts , is that the actual prompts themselves , are more flashy/tantalizing looking , and get upvoted a lot more than the more innocuous looking RF prompts , and get a lot more quick/short types of replies early on , etc .   Anyway , yea they are both good/fun , but I just wish there was a little more of the latter getting made . Not at the *expense* of the former , but rather , in *addition* to it .
It was roughly 2 years ago that the nukes went off , coating the entire planet in radiation . The only ones that survived were those in bunkers on the ground , and us in that were in the air at the time , high enough to fly above the radiation . Drones kept us going , delivering fuel every now and then to keep us up , as well as food and water in heavy , lead lined cases .   We got word that the radiation was rising . Before long , it would reach our maximum altitude , and our cells would slowly mutate to death . We got word that some kind of high-altitude aircraft would dock with us and transfer everyone on board , while our plane would be landed back down on the surface .   Well , it came , and guess who had to be sitting on the john ? You guessed it ! No one even remembered my existence . I 'm guessing they all just wanted more room for themselves , but oh well . There 's not much that can be done now . I can see them every now and then , flying overhead .   So when you folks eventually make it back down , I 'll try to have a record in here of how things are on the surface . Until then , I 'll be looking forward to my excruciating death .

And so zeus said `` Who invited the japanese ones ? I 'm not against the idea but could he have warn us before ? It will take time to get enough food to ten thousand more gods ...

Cyriac wiped the blood dripping off his chin , smiling sardonically while he tried to shake off the dizziness from Stephen 's left hook . He stood between Abe and Stephen protectively .   `` I always knew it would come down to this . You are too much of a coward to attack when he 's awake . '' Cyri growled , pulling out his old hunting knife . It hardly seemed adequate against Stephen , who was over a foot taller and 60 lbs heavier .   He dared to glance back at his older brother Abe lying still on the ground next to a terrified Rebecca . Abe was still breathing despite the head wound , which meant there was hope .   Stephen was by far the strongest guy in the group , but his night-time attack on Abe was clumsy . Cyri had managed to tackle him and knock his machete over the nearby cliff .   `` You 're done Cyri ; you and Abe . I 'm taking over and taking what I deserve . '' Stephen said , glancing greedily at Rebecca .   *Wake up bro ... I do n't think I can take him alone . *   `` You talk too much , dumb-fuck . '' Cyri motioned for Rebecca to run . She bolted , dragging the kids into the pitch black night with a silent sob .   Stephen bellowed and charged Cyri like a maddened bull , his huge muscles heaving with the effort .   `` And now ... we dance '' Cyri whispered . He rolled quickly to the right , hunting knife glittering in the light from the dying campfire .   EDIT : Made a few changes to the language for better flow .    
You . Yes **you** . I 'm so angry and disappointed I do n't even know where to start . You could have been so brilliant , in so many ways and yet you chose to tear yourself apart .   I spent an awfully long time repairing the damage you did . I know I am maybe not what you wanted to be , but we are what we are . I will not make apologies for the sound of my own voice . I will no longer cave to vanity and indulge in self destruction on a whim and a fancy .   I chose life , I chose *living . * I chose to be alive , I chose not to be shy , I chose to accept I was born this way , I chose to accept I will turn into our mother and I swear - that is a good thing . She is a formidable women , through the senile faffing and sometimes thoughtless comments , she gives nothing but everything she has . Every day . You are lucky and you do not know .   I am sorry you were not able to see what we could be . I forgive you for being so hateful . Through your hatred and resentment we made ourselves into something better . I just wish you had n't been so cruel to yourself when you would never have dreamed of doing so to another .   Do n't give up the fight , just turn your attention to bettering , not destroying . life will get better .   Yours , Future-You .  
Dreams do n't die in your head . They keep going . Out past your back yard , down the street , up into the air and out into space . Sometimes they pause and look around , marvel at the immensity of our insignificance , but mostly they just travel on . Mars , Jupiter , Saturn go by like billboards and the galaxy is just the small town they came from . They pick up some buddies in the local cluster and shoot off for the center of everything . They call this place the Crack .   The Crack is where all the Stuff came from . And now , in exchange for the Stuff , it 's sucking up all the Not-stuff . Dreams are n't Stuff , so in they go .   The problem is , Not-stuff has Not-gravity and it 's pushing at all the Stuff . Everything is flying apart faster than it can pull together and pretty soon the Stuff will be cold and dead and the Not-stuff wo n't have Stuff to not be . Which would make it Stuff .   To put it another way - The dreams of Stuff are congregating at the Crack and their Not-gravity is destroying Existence .   Pffffft was the first conscious creature to discover this dilemma . He was a really big Ant who lived on a planet without a name , in a galaxy on the far side of the Crack . . .  
“ You ’ re such an as- “   *Blink . *   “ -king him to go out , right ? But he sa- “   *Blink . *   “ -d lately . I don ’ t think I should be alone tonight . Could you come over ? ”   He quickly snapped the device into place , grunting in pain as the clamps tugged at his eyelids . “ Yeah , I think I can do that. ”   “ Great . I ’ ll leave the door unlocked , just come in when you get here. ”   “ All right , see you soon. ” He glanced over at a nearby mirror , checking to see if the devices fixing his eyelids open was overly noticeable . It was a rather haphazard design , but , considering the circumstances , it was a miracle he was able to throw something together at all . The oversized aviators hid most of the device from plain view , and a casually mentioned ailment was all he needed . That , and his saline drops .   -- -- - -- -- - -- -   AN : ~~Will continue later.~~ I lied . Went a different way with it in a different post .
I sit here on the peak of the mountain , gazing down on my kingdom - my world - reflecting on my actions . It wa n't meant to end this way ; so quickly ; so soon . No , it was n't , but that 's what happened , and it happened for a reason . Those people , all of them , claimed to be the best ; the greatest on Earth ; the children of God . *That* ... That 's an insult . That was their problem . I gave them exactly what they wanted , and , still , they denied all of it . They were always looking at the world through their own visions of what *should* be , not what *can* be , and especially not what *is* . That 's why they perished . If they were truly the greatest , *they* would be here , instead of me . How arrogant they were , believing that their God would save them ; believing that He would bring them salvation ; believing that He would damn all evil ... Evil . That 's a word they used to label anything that defied their beliefs of what *should* be ; anyone who defied that mystical man in the clouds . It 's funny how things work out , though ...
I had never been bothered by my special ability , I had never been particularly proud of it either . I could n't even say when exactly in my life I realised what I could do . For most of my child hood I did n't realise that I was the only one that could hear tomorrows weather , at the end of the day most people had already seen the weather report for the next three days so no one was impressed when I talked about the rain that was coming .   There were a few moments when I felt quietly smug that the reporter had gotten the next days weather wrong , but apart from that I just ignored the fact I could simultaneously hear today 's rain and the wind to come .   I did n't really care , I would hardly even watch the news to see if they would get it wrong .   But one morning when I woke up everything was different , I had a rush of fear thinking I had gone deaf as all I could hear was an all encompassing silence .   That was n't the case as I opened my window and heard the soft patter of rain falling .   It could only mean one thing , it could n't be true , but I was never wrong . I wanted to believe but it just seemed wrong .   Scotland was going to have a sunny day .
School shootings are obviously bad .   There 's no moral dilemma , no lesser of two evils .   What would compel you to shoot a man in the head ?   Food ? Money ? Love ?   It 's hard to kill a stranger , even when you have to .   If he 's hurt you though , it makes it a little easier to tell yourself , `` He wronged me . ''   Sometimes you might even think , `` He deserves this . ''   You forget to realize the shooter never leaves with his life : death by self , police , or jail . There is no `` life will get better . ''   If there 's any sense of justice in the world , these people who hurt me would be punished . Perhaps I should be punished too , but there are worse things than murder . And that is driving someone to commit it .   -- -   School shootings are accidents .   Preventable , perhaps , but also inevitable .   Kids are insensitive and sensitive all the same , and kids get hurt . Again and again and again . They live happily while I 'm forced to live . Why ? Why ca n't we just live in peace ? You tortured me and eventually convinced me that this dead-end choice was the right thing to do . To martyr myself to tell others ,   `` This pain will end . ''   I 'll never know that peace .  
To My Child ,   I want to start this letter off by telling you how important you are to me . I have , unfortunately , been sick for a few years now , but the day your mother told me she was pregnant with you was one of the best days of my life . The stress of medical tests , needles , and blood work faded away and , for that moment , I was so happy . Even now , when I 'm having a bad day , I think of you and all the wonderful things you 'll see . You have been a bright spot in my life and I will love you forever .   If you are a boy , I hope you look after your mother in my absence and if you are a girl , I hope you look more like your mother than you do me .   Just a few pieces of advice that your grandfather gave me : never get into a fight if you can help it , get your contracts in writing , if you 're ever chased by a bear , you only have to be faster than the person next to you , and smile ; you do n't own all the problems of the world .   Know that I love you and will always be with you .   Sincerely ,   Dad
Good Afternoon ! Thank you for calling Heaven ! I am God , how may I be of assistance to you today ?   Uh , hey ... I 'm uh ... not usually the praying type , but ... the doctor found a lump today , and he says it does n't look good .   I understand that you are feeling concerned about a lump that your doctor found that he said does not look good .   Yeah ... anyway , I was just hoping , that maybe the cancer 's not back . Things are not going so well after Julie died , and the kids really need me . Allie still cries all the time , and James is just always so quiet ... and I know they need time , but I think this might be more than they can handle .   I am hearing that you are wishing for the cancer not to be back , because Julie is deceased and Allie is crying and James will not speak , is this correct ?   Yeah ... that 's ... that 's about it .   Ok , please verify your information for me so that I can process your request . I will need the last four digits of the number on the bottom of your baptism certificate ...
**National Presidential Meeting**   `` We are here to take everyone home . '' The alien said .   Putin scratched his chin. `` I am inclined to agree with this offer . If a person is satisfied with everything the way it is , then that person is idiotic . ''   He leaned back in his chair glancing at Barack .   Barack locked eyes with him . `` I know why you 're giving me that look Putin . But stop poutin because I agree . We should n't wait for change , we should embrace . Go home ? Yes we can . ''   Trump scoffed . `` Listen fella 's . New planet , space ship , go home , yadda yadda . It 's all good and dandy but for free ? You aliens ever heard about business . Charge a couple hundred a seat , 7.3 billion people , you 'll make a killing . Start things off on the right foot . I 'm your man . ''   The alien turned to his alien friends . They nodded in unison turning back to the presidents . `` We will take you to home . Free . No charge . ''   The humans applauded and cheers went through the room .   **Before the meeting . **   `` I want to make human slaves , they works hard . '' The blue alien said .   Purple alien scratched his antenna . '' But work is back at home . How we can make them work from earth ?

News . Women . Tragedy and inspiration , wrapped up in a neat package for the masses to see . Another day in paradise , filtered through smoke and forgotten dreams . Hopelessly alone , connected through some unknowable darkness of tubes and overdue fees . Clicks . Clacks . Nothing of importance , but everything to us . It ’ s a grim reality that shades and clouds us now .   I don ’ t know what ’ s worse , the passive dullness of repetition or the need to press on . Hell , it ’ s always been this way . Different times call for different measures . I know that more than most . So if a million people , separated by black oceans and dreadful wastes , all feel the same fucking need to click through pages of empathetic stories and vicarious lives then who am I to stand in the way . It ’ s just another bombing in Baghdad , just another girl putting it all on the table . A storefront for the world to glare at and judge in lonely silence .   When the electric light shimmers across the faces of all the people so undauntedly aware of their own greatness , so perfectly content with fantasy and egomaniacal narcissism they can scarcely perceive a world beyond the screen , it ’ s hard to argue for the case of mankind . Click clack , get the door honey , life ’ s calling , I ’ ll be out in a minute .
Day 27- Expedition to Pregla Island .   It 's been almost a month since we landed on Pregla . Our team had heard of strange sightings here dating back to the Stone Age . We came here to expose whatever it was that inhabited the island . What we found here will change the world .   Last night we reached our destination . A temple that many sailors had seen before . They said that once a man enters , he can never return . We were going to enter the abyss .   It was a huge massive structure and oddly it looked made of metal but in the shapes of stones . I took a deep breath and told my companions that this part is not mandatory . I however will be going in regardless . A few chickened out but they also could keep watch from the other side . Elizabeth and Ollie joined me on the venture .   We began to walk though the temple . A weird line marked the floor and glee like it had some sort of bioluminescence . We followed it until we reach a gate . The door was oddly marked in thousands of languages . Japanese , German and finally English . `` The Operators of Atlantis '' .   We were puzzled but decided it was time to see what was behind the door . Elizabeth pushed it open . What we saw was amazing . Gigantic temples made of metal , flying cars and robots . It was as if a portal to another world . Then we saw a sign , `` Atlantis Founded 33 BC .
Light ... sun ... warmth . I can feel every iota of my being starting to move . Down to my very molecules are freeing up , being more active .   I can , I can pull myself together now , bead up and build up and be free . I 'm mobile . I start to slip thoigh . I 'm mobile but only downward . I cling to the surface . The surface that 's the same as me but so different . I hold it so tight but it ca n't stop by downward slide .   The sun is starting to be less warm , a cloud is passing . And I can see the end of my host , drawing ever nearer . It 's getting colder again , I feel more and more exposed as I reach the end of my home and suddenly stop . I 'm hanging on by just a few atoms .   It 's so cold again , and I 'm slowing down inside as well . Every part of me freezing bit by bit . And finally , I am one again with the icicle , growing the reach of my host , a drop of water no more .
`` Your daughter has the power of replenishing any object . ''   The shaman proudly proclaimed to the mother and father , that looked like they 'd been hit with a truck . Well , worse considering that the mother would heal from it in an instant and the father would levitate the truck out of the way first . She was a glorified soda machine ! Their daughter , all she could do was refill things ! The air crackled , as the holy ink wrote upon the paper :   Name : Lucy Sanchez   Date of Birth : 19 October 2003   Sex : Female   Parents : Marty Sanchez , Sabine Sanchez   All the usual things that a birth certificate should hold . And beneath all that , on a special extra line , the shaman signed in blood :   Power : Free Refills .   -- -   Twenty years later , Lucy stood at the graduation platform of hero school . She 'd graduated top of the class , and managed a cushy job as president of a tech company , at just twenty . `` So , Lucy , how do you do it ? You ca n't read minds , so how did you get the job ? ''   Lucy smiled and simply said `` Sleep refills . ''

Long ago , the land of Hyrule was beset by a terrible Demon King thought long dead . The sages of Hyrule did their best to contain his power and protect their people , but they were no match for him . When the Demon King 's armies had nearly overwhelmed them and it seemed that all was lost , the goddesses themselves sent a champion to vanquish the Demon King .   It was not enough . For in that hour of darkness , even the Champion of Hyrule fell to the corruption of the Demon King .   But the Demon King had made a terrible mistake- for instead of gaining a servant or an ally , he had unleashed a force of destruction that the might of all his armies could not contain . Wielding terrible power and singing a song of hatred and destruction , the Fallen Champion laid waste to all in his path , making no distinction between friend and foe .   With the last of his followers falling around him , the Demon King himself met the Fallen Champion on the field of combat .     Neither one emerged victorious . The world was torn to pieces and scattered by their conflict , and both perished in the void .     The Goddesses wept at the waste and the tragedy , and gave the two troubled spirits a chance at redemption .     Now , reborn into a single body and aided by the spirit of the last of the Sages , the Demon King and the Fallen Champion must walk between the worlds on a quest to heal the damage that they caused and reunite the fragments of the world they once destroyed .
`` I ca n't handle it . '' I said in a daze . It was all I could come up with .   `` Why not ? ''   `` It would be too different . '' As soon as I said it , I wanted to take it back . Even if it was as honest as I 'd ever been in my life .   `` How ? This is ... what ? Our second real date ? ''   The way she asked sounded so casual . So easy . She 'd lived centuries of theirs but only about three hundred days of ours . The anorexic staccato had aged out of her voice . At first , I thought she sounded languid . Almost as if all the years had left her beaten and bowed .   I felt an ersatz and pious charity towards her . Of course her voice was languid . Look at all she 'd been through .   But just then , she smiled . A real smile . What I 'd called languid was actually a very real aplomb . Very 'Let me know when the rapture gets here ' . The only time that mattered to her now was the now itself .   Finally she spoke again , `` They did n't want things to be 'different ' either . ''   The patch was starting to bring out the deep , emerald green of her remaining eye .   `` Back when they were still in chains . ''
Dear Jeff ,   I ... I do n't know how to say this . Or do this . And I can only imagine how everyone else is feeling . But I 'm torn between shock and sadness .   I barely started to know you . You were new to the car club , and I was n't the most active . But I got to know you quite a lot .   You brightened up the spirit of everyone around . And you inspired me . You showed interest in my passion , and in the span of when I saw you last week until Thursday , I had managed to teach myself so much , and was so excited to show you my plans and to ask you to be a part of my build .   I 'm not prepared to be there at your wake tonight . The team will be there , your girlfriend will be there too . She just told us you two were expecting . I promised her I 'd be getting that kid a Unicycle , figured you 'd get a kick out of that .   Well . Jeff . Thank you . You were always fun to talk to , and it was a hell of a season . I promise I 'll build Frankenstang and it wo n't be a kludge of a build because you convinced me otherwise .   I do n't know how to end this . Consider it an open letter because no one has even told me yet how you went . And we 're not even in our 30s bro . What happened ? Why 'd it happen .   ... Rest easy buddy . The team is here for you and Jheana .  
A man in futuristic attire stood before the scientists , `` We were responsible for Hitler 's rise to power . . . ``   `` What ? ! Why ? ! ? ''   `` In order to cause the war that would lead to the dictocomy of the Soviet Union and United States we had to do it . Without the space program from that conflict science would advance in marvelous ways , but , not into space . . . our version of Earth is days from being destroyed by an Asteroid . ''   `` Wait . . . you can alter time but not stop an asteroid ? `` , the scientist asked with a biting a tone .   `` We lack the infrastructure to develop a solution in time , advanced or not . . . that does n't appear overnight . . . We had made the earth a paradise , yet , we were inwardly focused . ''   `` Why could n't you just tell us this ? . . . ``   `` Would you have believed me ? Enough of you ? Your space program is in its infancy , but , you now have a chance at survival . We must go and face our destruction in our own reality . ''
Part of this I heard from a Muslim lecturer . This is how he narrated , in short .   We were first created as souls and all gathered together and asked who our Lord is ? In one voice all souls replied the one true God . That 's why in the middle of the deepest problem who ever you worship at that time you will remember the one God . If you worship Jesus or Ram or Buddha at that movement you wo n't ask from any of them but ask directly from God . This is because deep inside we know the truth .   Next he explained that all souls were stationed in garrisons and souls would meet each other . Sometimes they would become friends or at times would not see eye to eye with the other souls . He went on to explain that when we are born sometimes our recognition from the souls is brought with us that 's why when at times meet a person for the first time yet we feel we have known that person all our lives . At times we have a brother or sister we do n't get along with . Some of these things are from the soul stages .   After death we than go into another waiting stage where we in part either have it good or bad depending on how we have lived our lives on earth . This will be followed by Judgement Day when will be brought before God to answer for our actions which will than lead to either eternal bliss or eternal suffering .   In short that is the story of our souls .
`` I ... I ca n't believe it . ''   `` Me neither . ''   The girls both stared down at their feet for a good five minutes until Ella decided to break the silence .   `` How is it so ... so ... '' Ella stammered .   `` Beautiful ? '' Miranda replied , thinking nothing of how awful of an experience it had been for Ella .   `` Beautiful ? Yeah , just about as beautiful as a basket of dead puppies . ''   `` What was so bad about it ? ''   `` It was just ... I guess I did n't expect it to be like that . It was kinda grotesque . ''   `` I thought you knew about it . That 's what you told me , that you had done it before . ''   `` I have , but it was a while ago . It was n't like that before . Now it just feels gross . ''   `` Personally , I think it 's quite satisfying to finally know . I had no clue what it looked like before , well , you know . ''   `` Yeah , sure , whatever you say , but maybe we were n't supposed to see it . That 's why it is where it is , you know ? ''   `` I get it . ''   They started to look down again , then Ella , again , broke the silence .   `` Well , at least now we can tell our friends that we saw our own vaginas , because they do n't even know that it looks like that . ''   They stood hand in hand , knowing their world was changed forever ...
It is a period of procrastination . A high college freshman , at the verge of failing his world history class , must write a last minute essay about the major historic event to pass , mere hours before 11:59PM .   His eyes widened in fear , knowing he did n't pay any attention during the semester to recall many details - only something about a great civilization falling , a new one rising in its place , and a lot of bloodshed .   Desperate , he googles the ultimate asset : a WIKIPEDIA ARTICLE . Armed with just enough knowledge to include mentions of Lenin and a republic , he writes beautifully about the fall of the United Soviets Socialist Republic and rise of the Galatic Empire .   He does n't really remember this Death Tsar thing , but maybe it was destroyed in World War 2 when the United States dropped their photonic bomb . He concludes the 6-page paper with the following :   `` I believe the main lesson in the Tsar Wars was this : pay attention to your teachers . Obi-Wan told Anakin to be mindful of his feelings , if he listened and did what he said then his wife would n't be dead and the Shit Lord would n't have become Emperor ... ''   He concludes his paper , with only a few minutes to spare , and names it Tsar Wars . He smiles and takes another puff from his bong , content in the knowledge that a 100 % is ensured .

One fist , two fist , in fist , out fist ,   Closed fist , opened fist , closed fist , turned fist ,   This one is a little tight ,   This one is a little light ,   Say ! That one 's just right !   Yes , some take one and some take two ,   Some could even take a shoe ,   Some are trimmed and some are bare ,   Some have hair everywhere !   Why do some of them have bumps ?   I do n't know , go ask your mum !   Say ! Look at my fingers ,   One , two , three !   How many fingers do I see ?   One , two , three , four ,   Five , six , seven , eight , nine , ten .   That 's just one fist , let 's do it again !   One fist , two fist , four fists ! Eleven fists !   This is new !   I wish I 'd brought a little lube !   Bump ! Bump ! Bump !   Wan na hump ?   Wan na do it to Forrest Gump ?   If you 'd like to go bump , bump ,   Have a little late night hump ,   Just jump on my rump as we watch that Forrest Gump .   Who am I ? Oh , now you ask !   I very much enjoy this little task .   ... . oh you get the idea : P
Hey guys , did you hear about the government shut down ? It sounds terrible ! All those people being furloughed , it 's just not fair . Also , I think that our Congress should pass as many bills as possible regardless of their quality or constitutionality . If you question our government , you do n't deserve to live in America . Let 's not forget about Iran , either . They 're still trying to build nukes and threaten our ally Israel . And China is taking away our jobs and just look at what happened to Detroit . All I know is that they better not come for my social security and universal health care sounds like a good idea . I guarantee you I 'll vote out this do-nothing Congress next election ! I learned my lesson but God forbid whoever the other party nominates for President in 2016 ! It will be the death of America if my candidate does n't win . Will they care about our veterans and teachers and small business entrepreneurs and climate change scientists and our children ? Wo n't somebody please think of the children ? Speaking of children , abortion is a pretty hot topic upon which I 'll base my entire political philosophy . 9/11 Never Forget . Why have n't they imprisoned the bankers who brought this nation to its knees ? Wall Street should not interfere with our democracy , only corporate news stations should do that . Last night I heard on NPR that greenhouse gas emissions are up 5 percent from this time last year , is n't that a tragedy ?
My family heritage dates back to dog year 7933 from a German Shepherd named Archduke Cornelius Esqueband ... the caretaker named him Ace . He was a police dog and all 7 generations have served with our caretaker . Many risking fang and paw to protect him and many going down in the line of action .   The caretaker took good care of my family and I have fond memories of him letting me run round in the large field which I owned of course . The caretakers son had helped my father 's generation and was caretaker to my uncle until he ate a rasin . What a way to go ...   The caretaker is slow nowadays , he relies on other people took care of him , but I guard and love him none the less . The younger master often visits ... but today the owner was holding something in his shaking hand , a lead .   I dreaded the day I would face this ceremony , when a god gives another god a being to guard them ... my uncle failed them already and I was never taught anything about this .   I became a service dog like my forefathers before me , however several dog years had passed before I could see my first master again . He was lying down and was in pain , he spoke two words to me which resonated in my very soul ...   Good boy ...  
This was definitely the most interesting bar I had worked at . Religious officials walked in wearing their vestments . Normally I would think they would n't want to wear these things while off duty , and going to a bar of all places , but here they were .   The bouncer outside had seemingly arbitrary requirements for letting people in . He refused to let it mushroom people , but he let in a sapient talking horse . He was n't a centaur , but a fully sentient horse . He was always sad , and I 'd ask him why the long face . He 'd pour his heart out to me , and it was quite a sad story really . Even sadder than the guy who walked in and alcoholism destroyed his family . One night the bouncer slipped up and let in a non-sentient horse that somehow wondered by . It whinied and shat on the floor before leaving . The mushroom person who continued to try and get in saw this and raised hell on why an animal was allowed in , but he was continuously stopped .   Also , I had never seen so many high profile people in one bar before . In just one week , I had served movie stars , rock stars , and even world leaders . I started to think something was fishy , and all of it somehow seemed familiar . At the end of my night , as I drove home , a chicken darted across the street . It bothered me as to why it did that . Clearly to get to the other side , but why was it headed that way and where did it come from ?
Just finished you 're story and I got ta say it was a ride . I really enjoyed watching the unlikely friendship form then fall apart . Also the differing ideologies between Ben and Pat were very clear and well done . In the final act of the story you really hit your stride writing wise , the situation felt genuinely confusing and desperate for Harry . The refugee camp felt almost like a purgatory with everyone waiting and slowly dying , I liked that . Pat as we was introduced was also provocative like he was a little devil , good foreshadowing .   The story covered a lot of ground very quickly and I felt as though you needed to spend more time with Harry as he was growing up . You had a lot of room to expand the story and I felt as though a couple things needed to be explained better . Several events seemed to happen without any real explanation like the teacher killing herself , Ben appearing in the climax , a sense of place , and the procession into the city . I went back and reread a couple times in case I missed something . These things can be addressed if you continue to expand this story .   Anyway I really hope you continue working with this , it 's a truly compelling story .
I sighed . Oh ... my ... gosh , seriously lady ?   She kept screaming WHY IS SHE SCREAMING ? !   Gah !   Okay , back up .   Let 's start all over . I woke up , went downstairs , made up breakfast , drank my tea and read the newspaper . Okay .   I went outside , to get the mail that I forgot yesterday . I keep forgetting . Gosh darn it . Anyway , this kid whizzes by on a skateboard . Well that 's fine .   But then ... his skateboard hits this indention in the sidewalk . It swings up , he crashes , and it falls ... right on me .   I can feel the blood falling down my cracked skull , and tug my hair out of my eyes . His mother keeps SCREAMING . I dunno if he died . You could , I guess . No , wait , he 's moving .   `` Stop freaking out , it was just an accident ! ''   She screams harder when my wound heals instantly , and I swipe the blood away with a fingertip , licking it away .   It BARELY hurt .   Oh . Why is she still screaming ? Oh , right . Media portrayal says my kind does n't do well in the sun , or drinks only blood .   Well . Liars . Whatever . I shrug as she yanks her son inside her house , calling 911 . I go in , get dressed for my morning run .   It 's a usual day .
I was afraid .   They had told me about the risk . They had warned me about the sacrifice . I knew what they were asking of me , and I went anyways .   My daughter wept when I left . My son was silent for days . They asked when I would be coming home . They asked me what I was leaving for . They asked me why I would leave them alone when their world was collapsing around them . I wept when I could only respond with silence .   I looked over at my second in command strapped into her chair beside me . She was sweating and her breathing was uneven . Her eyes held the same fear that gripped me . The blackness outside was overwhelming—each second we traveled further into space felt like a second closer to death .   I clenched the sides of my chair as my vision became distorted . We were traveling into a wormhole . It loomed in front of us , a maelstrom of stars and matter swirling in the distorted darkness . I felt my consciousness fade as my heart beat through my chest . The cabin folded around us as the bonds of reality collapsed .   Through the cold silence , a familiar voice came over the intercom . I remembered the words from a poem I had heard long ago .   “ Though my soul may set in darkness , it will rise in perfect light ; I have loved the stars too fondly to be fearful of the night. ”   As we slipped into the void , my fear trembled , then softened to a whisper of doubt .  
The sky is particularly blue today , like the colour of the ocean down at the tropics . Blue , with a bit of green . The sun hangs high and proud , beaming brightly with brilliant orange-yellow light . There is n't a cloud to be seen , except for the little one over there-     I cock my head to the side , examining it . It 's shaped vaguely like a dog . ... Maybe a whale ? I was never good at cloud-shapes more complicated than `` triangle '' or `` popcorn . ''     *Yeah* , I think with a contented sigh and slip my hand under my tank top to rub my stomach . *I could eat some popcorn . * But I 'm much too lazy to get up right now , the sky is much too blue , and this grass is much too comfortable . So , instead of satiating my craving for buttery snack foods , I stretch my legs out and fold my left arm under my head , and continue my gaze upon the vast blue above .     ... And a person zooms by .     Just ... right across the sky .     `` What the fuck ? '' I say , perhaps a little louder than I would have if I 'd been policing my words .     But , just .     What the fuck ?
Last night was wild ! That girl was a dream come true ! I just hope I did n't permanently scar my furniture into hating me ...   I rolled out of bed and into my slippers , no warm fuzzy feeling greeted me though . In fact my slippers were stone cold . Okay maybe a pair of slipper should n't be worn while doing the deed . `` Maybe my slippers could grow up a bit ... ''   The temperature of my feet definitely dropped another degree and they grew heavy on my feet .   I slipped them off and made for the door , which would n't budge . Okay so I agree that thing with the door handle took things a little to far , buuuuut ( hehehehe ) that 's what she wanted . `` Pleaaaaassseeee ? '' I cooed , polishing the knob delicately . I made to open the door again and it barely budged , when the opening was large enough I slipped through and into the bathroom .   The taps would n't turn on ... Nor would the shower . And the toilet was n't flushing either . `` Guys ... I did n't even come in here last night did I ? '' And then it hit me , of course I did ! All the best bits were in here ... Well I think that was a decent trade off .   I picked up my mobile and exited the camera . Oh yes , my trusty camera never got annoyed at my wild nights out , he still worked just fine . I pulled open a new tab and searched `` affordable furnished homes '' .   Looks like I was moving .
It started out cool . We only had like 12,000 residents . Then the humans found out the true religion . Who ever let the dogs out fucked everything up . Soon as you know it everyone was at the pearly fucking gates . I was pissed . I was doing overtime reading the fucking book of life for 10 years at a time . After the 360th riot , we started to let everybody in cause the milk was spilled , we had to . I was sick of the Man breathing down my neck stressing me off a Hell quota he knew damn well I could n't fulfill . So the cloudy paradise turned to fucking Rio De Jeniero . All the humans brought there earthly possessions into Heaven cause they found out you could bring all your money to the afterlife . Guns , Dope , Sex , and Basketball ran rampant . I was just here for the close connection to my Lord and Savior but who the fuck was I ? The Man grew negligent . Gave me the Love of the Lord budget for me to do as I pleased . I called in the Angel Militia of All that 's Holy . Martial law ensued . The Angels and I implied a 1000 year curfew but the drugs and 500 year Warriors Basketball games ensued . I wrote a bill to impeach The Man for his lack of guidance . But who gives a fuck . Go Warriors !
`` Not again , '' I groaned . This was the third time in a week that I had woken up to a dragon leering at me from atop a mountain of gold . `` Why does this always happen to me ? '' I shouted in exasperation , as I nocked my arrow . I back pedaled as I unleashed a torrent of arrows on my ever encroaching foe . Luckily for me , this breed of dragon was relatively harmless because of their slow speed , they were known , however , for their huge endurance . Hours passed as I kited the beast around in circles , ducking behind the pile of gold to avoid the occasional flame blast . Eventually , the dragon began to stagger and its movements became sloppier . It raised its head towards me and let out a measly puff of smoke before its eyes rolled upwards and it collapsed with a thud . `` I swear , if I have to kill this thing one more ti- ''   `` You see this , Steve ? '' Josh exclaimed , `` every time I log back into the game the dragon 's always dead and I get free loot . I think I 'm just going to park this character here every time I 'm about to log out from now on . ''
Harry strutted through the far side of the barrier , his designer robes flowing freely above his custom Air-dan Lynch sneakers . A hush fell over the platform as all eyes turned toward the Boy Wonder , a mixture of contempt and wonder flashing across their faces .   `` What the bloody hell are you looking at ? '' He snapped .   He pushed his way through the throng of onlookers followed by his house elf Voldy .   `` Hurry up with my trunks or I 'll slay you like your namesake . ''   Harry ascended the steps onto the Hogwarts Express , walking down the corridor til he found his spot , the one he paid for and named `` Harry Potter Commemorative Compartment '' . Inside was a scruffy red haired boy .   `` Why in the name of Grindelwald are you in here ! ? ! ''   `` I 'm Ron , Ron Weasley , we talked over the owl post ? I 've got the dragons dandruff you wanted. ``   Ron pulled out a vial filled with white powder and poured some out on the table . Harry quickly pulled a parchment tube from within his robes .   Just as he was leaning over the table the compartment door slid open . Harry turned to see a mane of bushy brown hair and a surprised face in the doorway .   `` Oh thank God , I did n't think we 'd be able to find any of the good shit at this stupid school . I 'm Hermione by the way , Hermione Granger . ''  
I 'll give you definite points for using 'in medias res ' to come into the middle of a sex scene between two people competing to see who can reach the bottom of the gutter first . At first , it was really hard to figure out what was going on , but once your dialogue warmed up , you sped along nicely . When you eventually come back to do revisions on it , for whatever purpose you give the piece , I would definitely take a good hard look at the perspective on the section that is n't from Kyle 's perspective . It was really hard to discern what was happening until after most of the gross-factor shocks had run through in the narrative .   Also ... No matter how many times I re-read “ I actually came back here with you cause , honestly , I kind ’ a thought there was a possibility you might kill me. ” and tried to figure out the context , it looked like he was the one saying it , but the follow up dialogue implied she did . It would have been a nice twist on the usual strong-vs-weak comparison if that had been the case . Huge guy , gristly , carved out of wood and misery , with a death wish for his one night stands .   All in all ... keep it up . With revision , it would be compelling to a very particular kind of audience . Kind of a Fight Club/Choke meets Sin City vibe . I 'd read that .
*Look at her . She grows more and more beautiful every day . Brushing her hair , staining those perfect lips red . She is dressed for a night out , I do love it when she gets all dressed up . *   *One more quick glance at herself before she leaves , beautiful as always . She looks so like her mother , and grandmother before her . I have loved many pretty little girls and beautiful young women in this family as they have cherished me , passing me down from one generation to the next . I am not as beautiful as I once was , my beautiful wood warped and stained with lipstick and nail polish . My once flawless mirror showing signs of age . These women love me regardless of -- *   *Oh , she 's back ! I do hope her evening was -- *   *Who 's that with her ? *   *No ! No ! *   *Not her ! *   *Run , baby girl ! ! Run ! *   *No ! My beautiful girl . *   *This is the only time in my fifty years that I have wished to be anything other than what I am . I wish I had eyes ; I would cry*
Dear Violet   I 'm sorry .   I 'm sorry I did n't tell you how I felt about you . I was always nervous when it came to girls , you of all people should remember that .   I 'm sorry I did n't hang out with you more . I always thought I would have time later , but I never made time for it .   I 'm sorry I did n't dance with you at prom . I know I promised you that I would , but you looked like you were having fun with your new boyfriend and I did n't want to ruin it .   I 'm sorry was n't there when you needed help moving out . It all happened so fast with you and Mike breaking up and getting back together again so much , I did n't think it would stick that time .   I 'm sorry that I did n't get to say goodbye when you left . I did n't think you 'd leave without telling me .   For as long as I have know you , you 've always been the friend that awkward , nerdy kid needed . I probably would n't be here if it were n't for you . I mean it . I was n't in a good place before I met you.It may not have been under the best circumstances that we became friends , but I would n't have had it any other way .   I do n't know if you 'll feel the same way , or if this is the right time to say it and I have no idea how else to say this so I 'll just say it .   Violet Brindley   I love you .   Yours Truly   Tim  
Donal Trump woke up that morning , knowing he was in for a heck of a debate . First , he was scheduled to make some off the cuff comments about women , and then he had to buy a new toupee , and then he had a presidential debate with Kanye West . But Donald Trump , according to Donald Trump , knew how to get things done .   And get things done he did , or at least the two things on his to-do list anyways . The time came for him to take on Kanye West in the presidential debate . He arrived early and ready to go . He sat down at his assigned seat , and waiting for mr. West . Kanye was late , but arrived nonetheless . Kanye sat down opposite mr. Trump , and the presidential debate of 2015 began . Mr. Trump has the first word . `` Well , if I were president , I would get all those rapists and murderers out of the U.S and send them back to Canada where they belong . I also ... '' Kanye West interrupted at this point . `` imma let you finish , but Obama was the best president of all time . I am also Black , therefore , logically , I will be the best president of all time as well . '' He mic-dropped and left the debate , sure he would win by a landslide . He did . Mr.Trump never did get to finish .  
Mummy always said to be careful , to keep my sleeves unrolled and to never show anyone . I thought she would be angry at me when i came home from school with my jacket missing , but she just seemed scared . She grabbed me and asked if anyone saw , I told her only Abigail , and her face went white .   We had to leave , mummy said . We had to go quickly and not go to piano lessons , which I did n't mind so much . But we had to leave Mr Fluffykins behind , and Sarah the Bear . We drove away very fast and did n't stop until it was night . It 's been a while since then and I do n't know when we 'll go back home . I wonder why Mummy does n't want anyone to see my number , Abigail told me the number one was special , I would n't have shown her otherwise . Do you think the number one is special Mister ?   Mister ? Where are you going ? Why did you ask me questions if ypu do n't want me to tell you ? Oh no , suit people I better tell Mummy .

The world had been in disaray for as long as I could remember , and that had been a long time - 69 years , 11 months , and 29 days to be exact . Ever since the event infused humanity with powers , the world had fallen apart . Rampant crime and terror had overtaken the planet as villains become supervillains , and heroes became complacent . No one wanted to be an accountant when they could save the planet , nobody wanted to work at a power plant when they could travel through time as easily as the rancid air that all on the planet breathed . But in the chaos of the world , the only rule was that the power always came before the 50th birthday . Except in my case . And although the people lived forever , and fought wars forever , were sick forever , and watched their society crumble forever , immortality to all had always been seen as the blessing that came after the Event .   Only I could see it as it was - the fence that kept the people in the cage that the God that had either failed them , played a cruel game on them , or been killed by the humans he raised so high that they could only fall long ago . They were all rats in a cage . All but me .   And so , on my 70th Birthday , I finally gained my power . I awoke . I breathed . I saw . I breathed . I saw . And so I chose , I used my power , and I died .
I can hear you .   Just listen to me please .   I know this probably wont get though .   I just have to try though do n't I .   You never understood did you ?   Just listen , I love you , I always loved you .   This is it then ?   The end ?   I ca n't handle this , I ca n't take a life with out you .   If you keep hurting me like this ... I do n't know what I will do   Do n't be stupid Frankie ! Shut up .   No she does n't need to hear that .   Why do want to hurt her !   I 'm sorry , I know this is too much .   Why ca n't you just take me back , was I that bad ?   I 'm not obsessed !   You 're the one who cant handle this , it 's your emotional problem !   FUCK YOU .   ______________________________________________________   The other side .   You have reached the voice mail of Sharon Smith . I am not able to get to the phone right now , but please leave a message after the beep . Unless this is Frankie , I told you I 'd call the police if you rang again   BEEEEP
He massages his voice , finally he can stop using that damn fake British accent . He was a shitty bartender in levels two to thirty before finally being a bonus choosable player ; that 's when he could shed this accent and smash beer bottles on the heads of orcs . No one ever played long enough to unlock him though , if they did they always chose the jester first or the wrestler who had much catchier phrases than `` drink up ! '' .   Jim , the bartender , opened his eyes after a long restful massage of his neck . All the fighters were here , even the enemies that spent their lives in the dungeon were crowded into this auditorium . A few warriors took on the hordes of enemies but they were replaced in seconds , reincarnated as if the servers were n't running . A fiery bat flew over his head , that 's when he saw it . A small rotating white circle on black canvas with a percentage . It was server maintenance window , or an update , which meant only one thing- `` Drink up ! '' He was useful .
I got home late , it was the 15th of January , my birthday . No party , just me coming home to the lady , a foot massage and some chocolate cake . Almost at the door , I shifted through my bag to find the keys and unlocked the door . Taking my shoes off , I noticed a pale yellow light coming from the door at the end of hallway . Pounding footsteps came , right before the door slid sideways . She stood there for a moment , tears starting down her face as she looked at me with a light in those green eyes . She ran the two feet between us , as if she could n't reach me fast enough . *What's* *wrong* , I felt the tears started down my neck as she hugged me . She squeezed harder mumbling*Im pregnant* .   I remember the feel of blood rushing in me at the words , the sudden *thump* *thump* *thump* *thump*of my heart between my ears . She held me , not wanting to let go . It felt as if minutes passed but after a deep breath and a glance down at the small head hiding in my shoulder .   *Okey* That was all I could manage and she never lets me forget .
The sound of the booming siege device crashing against the last gate thundered through the black halls . In every shadow stood ready the final guard , the last and most elite of Demon kind . Upon a throne of pustules and bone , Lucifer sat wearing a calm face of malice while inside he felt fear for the first time in millennia . Fear for his once prey , fear of humanity .   Slowly , one by one , each Demon from the weak to the strong had fallen . To the minds of human kind they had swayed , possessed . No amount of persuasion or magicks could call them back to their bodies , they had simply vanished from existence ; their bodies left behind , tools of warfare for the humans .   Now the entire forces of Hell itself had collected at the final gate , Humanity in the guise of Demons , prepared to finish the job . They had come to conquer and slay the beast within , the Lord of Hell himself their goal and aim . Nothing would stop them .   The cracking of stone and steel signaled the end as one of the fore guard could be heard crying through the halls , `` To Arms ! ''
Bowsers gon na be pissed ... .   Uh hello this is Gumba number 00345 reporting from the 1-1 sector .   yea , uh hu , everything is fine over here ... . except one thing .   well , you see sir ... . Gumba 00344 sorta just got stepped on .   yea I do n't really know how this happened either sir .   well I mean we were walking the usual beat , between those two pipes . And it just sorta happened . the red guy popped up , and then bang gone .   00344 just sorta disappeared ... . I do n't know what I 'm gon na say to his wife .   ...   I mean I 'm not really sure what the significance was of us walking between those two pipes ... seems kinda pointless . And from a tactical standpoint it sorta makes it easier for us to get stepped on .   ... .   yes sir   I understand sir .   Well the red guy just sorta kept running , seemed like he was in a hurry   no sir I could n't chase him because of the pipes   actually how did I manage to get between those pipes anyway ? I cant really jump or anything   ... .   yes sir .   I 'll ask less stupid questions sir .   I understand sir .   alright roger that sir .    
That ball . That fucking ball , is there again .   Sitting so smugly there , in the middle of the fucking floor , just fucking waiting for me to come pick it up , brush it off , and throw it back in the fucking closet . Where it should stay .   But it wo n't stay , now will it ? I 'm gon na do just that , get dressed , go to work , come home , fall asleep , wake up , and it 's going to fucking be there again .   Maybe it 's even already there before I go to sleep again . I 've never checked . Never thought to ... or just been too afraid to really admit that a FUCKING BALL is running my life .   I mean ... balls roll ... right ? I suppose I could just have a faulty closet door ...   No . You know damn well that door closes firmly , with the audible click of a properly working door .   And yet , here is the ball . Is it staring at me ?   No , that would be ridiculous . Balls do n't have eyes .   But they also do n't open doors .   And ... I could just be losing my goddamn mind here , but I could swear there 's just something ... off , about where it 's sitting . Like the space around that infernal , blue dimpled rubber ball is slightly curving around it , or it 's at an angle that would otherwise force a normal ball to roll one way or another .   But this one is different . It stays .   I 'm going back to bed .

The beginning was small . /r/badlinguistics had a minor territorial dispute with /r/conlang , as someone had made a linguistically unsound conlang . Nothing major . But soon , the situation escalated . The grand admins used their velar stops to fight the improper syntax and Chomskyism of /r/badlinguistics . Quickly , /r/subredditdrama came to the scene in their grand airships , overlooking the vast battles . However , they came into conflict with /r/cringeanarchy , on their Sonic-boats and fur-mechs . They were aided by /r/indianpeoplefacebook , /r/forwardsfromhitler and /r/shittyfacebookmemes . This drew in further extensions ; /r/forwardsfromgrandma came with the memelords and bakemasters , and /r/funny came to scavenge the superior memes from le reddit brigades . On the side of /r/conlangs was the Imaginary Network , who summoned great artwork to fight the shitpost armies , and /r/worldbuilding used their power over pocket dimensions to trap enemy infantry . On the side of the cringers and /r/badlinguistics was /r/jontron and /r/nlsscirclejerk , who brought forth swood legions , crowbars , wait no actually it snapped in two , and velvet gloves .   Much blood was shed . Years went by . Death and destruction was wrought .   However , a certain threshold was reached . So many dead , and other forces get involved .   *Old* forces .   *Powerful* forces .   One day , corpse upon corpse in the post-fields permalinked together . Together , they formed a vast human chain . Piece by piece , the monster grew and grew .   And they rose as one .   `` RRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRRREEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEE !

I dwell forever among the mortals . Each one knows me , but acknowledge me not . There is one mortal who is a seeker ; and this one seeks me out . The mortal has sought me out but could find me not ; as I was hidden where the mortal would not dare to look . Now the time is come that I am revealed . A deep sleep was arising over the mortal , and I made my presence known . I breathed and the body shook , my gaze broke through the mind and seared through the heart .   The mortal spoke to me :   Mortal : Are you the one I seek ? Are you God ?   God : Who is this 'I ' that seeks ?   Mortal : It is me .   God : Who are you ?   Mortal : I am a human .   God : Who is this 'I ' that is human ?   Mortal : I am .   God : What is this 'I ' ?   Mortal : It is my self .   God : From where does the self arise ?   Mortal : ( after a long pause ) I suppose that it arises from you .     I then shook the mortal awake ; and I appeared fully onto him . I said unto him :   I am you ; and you are I   My presence swept the mortal away . I watched him fall before me ; and I remained alone .  
I sit on the edge of my bed , clutching a stack of bright paper covered in Crayola . *How did I end up here ? What do I say to her ? * I start reading all of the letters again , hoping that this time they say something different . The last one sends shivers through my bones .   Michelle ,   Thank you for taking such care with all of my letters . I 'm glad my solution to working around the lack of postage was helpful . The tooth fairy assists me in reading your wonderful letters , though they are much too heavy for her to carry all the way to my home . It gets too hot for her dainty wings here . I was delighted to hear about the cat . She was rotten and deserved her fate .   You 're such a wonderful girl . I get many letters from girls and boys every year , but they quickly realize their mistake and stop writing me . It 's quite lonely . Dyslexia is a plague created specifically for me . You are always faithful , though . You never forget my name , never cease to sing my songs or carry out my rituals .   I enjoy milk and cookies as much as anyone , thank you by the way .   Have you been naughty lately ? I 've heard reports about missing children , truly naughty boys . I 'm proud of you , my daughter . I 'll see about that dress you want , you 've got to make the list .   Love ,   `` Santa ''
In the year 2552 , Noble Six failed to reach the UNSC *Pillar of Autumn* . Cortana was never delivered , and without her guidance , the *Autumn* was easily captured by Supreme Commander Thel 'Vadamee . Under the Prophets ' behest , the cryopod holding the Master Chief was refitted to interface with Covenant systems aboard the planetoid station *High Charity* . There , the Oracle of *High Charity* recognized the hardware implanted into S-117 , and began interacting with him , trying to explain the reality that the Prophets mistook as religion . After convincing the Master Chief of his importance , the Oracle segmented a portion of himself into the Spartan 's neural interface .   After 3 years , the Master Chief was released from his cryopod , aware of the threat looming over both humanity and the species forming the Covenant . The Sangheili , being a true warrior species , recognized the way the Master Chief carried himself , and V'rtha 'Fahi was eventually tasked in evaluating the `` Demon '' as a possible member of the Covenant .   Several months passed , and the Demon was soon recognized as an merited member of the Sangheili . Attaining the rank of Commando , the Demon was assigned to the *Purity of Spirit* .
You and I never met . I never heard your heartbeat , never saw you grow . Never did your tiny feet learn their way down the hall , and never did they slip into tiny shoes- velcro first , then laces .   Never did I hold your hand on the first day of school , nor did I tear up when you let go and went inside . Never will I know what your favorite subject would have been , if you liked class or not . I never found out if you wanted to dance , or play soccer .   I never watched you throw your cap to the sky , never cried because you were growing up . I never helped you pack and move away to bigger , brighter things .   I never listened to your call at three in the morning , never helped you see that your first love would not be your last . I never helped you pick up the pieces of your heart .   I never heard about your great job , your promotion , your travel plans and the wonderful countries you fell in love with . I never got to know the person you decided to spend your life with .   I never got to see you in a pretty white dress , or a dress of any kind . I never got to know you as your own person , learn your hopes and dreams .   The doctors never told me anything was wrong , until they did n't have to .   I never got to do any of it , but that did n't stop me loving you anyway .
Have you ever heard a song for the first time and gotten it stuck in your head ? It 's a catchy tune and it 's so damn good , you 're just in awe right off the bat ? It has the makings of a classic . Years from now , you 'll still play it and bop your head to it as a warm smile extends across your face .   She 's that song .   She 's that song you get stuck in your head first thing in the morning and remains there until you 're trying to go to sleep at night . She 's the kind of song that no matter what mood you 're in , you feel a thousand times better just hearing the first note . Her lyrics alone are worthy of getting inked onto your skin in some font that tries desperately to capture their essence . Each kiss and embrace is a precise strike of the drum . Each loving stare , a low , meaningful pluck of the bass string .   And sure , sometimes you may listen to the song too many times in a row , but therein lies the beauty of this masterpiece : no one gets tired of a classic .
`` Both of you drop and give me two hundred . ''   `` I was on leave , and you called me back in so I could do pushups ? I 'm sorry but that does n't seem very nice or fair . ''   `` Really ? I do n't have a problem with it at all . I 'd just given my wife a hug , patted my kid on the head and was thinking to myself , I 'd like to get back on base for a little more punitive train- ''   `` You have the right attitude , son . You only have to do a hundred and fifty pushups . ''   `` Wow . Thanks . Really takes the sting out of- ''   `` One handed . ''   `` That 's actually going to make it a lot harder . ''   `` Were you using your leave to finish out your doctorate ? ''   `` Why would you think that ? My girlfriend and I- ''   `` Shut the fuck up . I 'm going to balance this coffee on your head , and if you talk , you 're going to get burned . ''   `` That 's going to solve all his problems , I 'm sure- ''   `` Shut up . ''   ...   `` Sir , I 'm having a blast , but- ''   `` I told you to keep that gaping maw shut . I want to see how long golden boy can avoid saying anything stupid . ''   `` Golden ? I 'm not even -- OH GOD . That coffee was VERY HOT ! ''

`` Ma'am ? Can I help you ? ''   I can barely see the man 's face , the headlights are so bright . White beams in the dark , blinding in the still night air .   `` Ma'am ? ''   He 's behind the wheel of a slim , sleek car , head poking out of the side window . The side door opens and the man steps out . He 's young .   `` Can I give you a lift or something . Or my - my jacket ? You must be freezing out here . ''   He 's right . I am . It 's cold . The snow is unforgiving .   I duck my head as he walks towards me , and when he goes to put his jacket over my arms the knife in my head plunges into his chest . Deep .   Red blood squirts out . His mouth forms a wide 'O ' , his eyes likewise . He falls to the   The engine 's still running inside . It 's warm , and there 's a song playing - vaguely electronic .   I drive away , the crumpled body on the highway just another lump in the dark . Windshield wipers stop the snow from building up , and the white flakes threaded in my sweater are melting , melting in the heat .   He 'd seen me already ; I 'd just helped him along ... Besides . Who can say no to heated seats ?  
He is , John ! The Most Paranoid Man in the World   Born premature to Gail and David , a newborn babe whose health was faded   They named him John , innocuously , more for the sake of bureaucracy   David dropped him on his head , by mistake , or so he said   He grew up weedy , knock-kneed and weak   His mother 's cooking made his prospects bleak   At night she kissed him on the neck , probably just to keep him in check   At school his grades were n't bad , that is , unless he was being had   Years later he found a job in finance , and rather quickly a girlfriend called Nance   Nance only loved him for his car , it was red like her head and took them far   They drove through the English Channel Tunnel , which Thank God did n't bury them in rubble   In France they did n't hire a guide , everyone took them for a ride   Nance spoke French , with an accent , the waiter did n't seem to mind   A little discount on the food , left John in a sour mood   He stormed out he realised , no one looked him in the eyes   What if they knew ?

I stare at my arm , looking at the scar tissue next to my real number . As a child it was passable , but now , as a grown man , everyone could tell what my parent had done . An angry scar that used to clearly read `` 15 '' sat next to a perfect `` 1 . '' They had done it out of fear , and I knew that now . I did n't as a boy when every winter they would re-brand my arm in an effort to conceal my identity . But now , sitting alone , I wondered what they had been so afraid of . They could n't have known what was coming , could n't have known the impact it would have . They just knew something was different about me , that I was the last of something .   And I am the last of something . I am the last man standing among the wreckage . I am the oldest person alive today , but that wo n't last long . The war was long and terrifying . But it is nearly over . It ends with me , here , staring at my severed , scarred arm .   I just hope the 1 meant that I 'm the last one to die for this . I hope after me , my best friend who was born after me , will rebuild and do it right . If he fails , maybe the numbers will come back .
I 'm standing front of the house . Halloween night as usual . I try to make myself a urban legend . Who really believes in a murder on Halloween night ? With tons of rumors about this type of stuff nobody believes it , perfect .   My victim is a millionaire businessman . With such a big house this should be easy . I look through the window and I see him yelling at his teenager and his friends for being to loud . This going to be hard now , I did n't expect kids . There watching a horror movie . A slasher of some kind . They will this .   .First I torment the kids . I knock on each window in there living room . They look around and lock the door . And when this is happening trick and treaters come and they open the door slower and slower . But I break in through the back . Easy .   Now that I 'm in I need to be careful I walk around slow while I check around every corner . I go up the stairs trying to find the parents if I do that I can get the kids easy . Simple . They are in the shower . Pull out my knife . They scream . It 's done .   But then something happens . The kids heard me .   I hear them in the kitchen . I go slow .   tap   tap   tap   tap   tap   I see them .   It 's done   Not them   Me .   they have a gun .
Running on soft . Soft is for sleep and have sleeped . Running on the soft was n't real , but now Friend gets long belt which will mean running will be real . Friend is good .   Friend takes to bigger Friend who I get into and bigger Friend growls which means he is waking up . Bigger Friend will take us to the green place for running . Running is my favourite time , especially when Friend has Ball .   Friend and bigger Friend stop before we get to green place . This makes me confused . But Friend pats me on the head and pulls on the long belt which means we have to go together . I trust Friend to take me somewhere fun , so I follow him .   The place Friend has taken me is full of smells . Many other friends to make and some enemies . However Friend says `` Sit '' so this means I have to stay with him and wait to make other friends . Soon an animal like Friend appears and she will also be my friend because she pats me on the head . I then lay down when she pats my bottom ...   We did n't got to the green place . I do n't like the smells place . Friend did n't do good things , unless he did n't know about what the animal like Friend was going to do ... Friend keeps hugging me so I think he understands it was not good . Maybe Friend will take me to the green place to make up for this soon .
`` I 'm not here to kill you . '' I raise my hands in the air to show him I mean what I say .   Hitler draws his lips into a smile . `` How did you get in here ? ''   `` I came from the future . ''   I 'm not sure whether I expected disbelief , but Hitler sits easily in his living room , right foot crossed over his left . He lights a cigar . `` And what does the future have to say ? ''   `` The future hates you , '' I say , saliva flying out from my lips . `` The future will hate you , '' I say , correcting my tense .   Hitler looks out the window , towards the country he has finally conquered . He is smiling . He knows what he is about to do . He has it all planned ; no trace of spontaneity clouds his mind with doubt .   I stare straight at him , my mind wavering but my gaze insistent . `` Think about how you will be remembered . ''   Hitler turns towards me . His smile does not dissolve like I expect . Instead , it grows wider . Almost warm . `` At least I will be remembered '' -- a pause -- '' and that 's all that matters once we return to the very graves we trampled on , nein ? ''
I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I I   Seventeen 'I 's . Seventeen eyes . Eight pairs of eyes and one alone and green and red , glowing like a Christmas tree in undulating significance .   You walk to me , strut saunter shake swag in my direction , sinking sinking sinking down to my level , dime store high heels clicking ticking clicking clocking mocking me , moving me , using me . Dime bag in hand of the spoon full of sugar to help the medicine go down .   Sink it all down to my level . Eye level . I level with you when you ask me for my stipend and I show you only my heart in hand , shattered sentiments of madness , mirrors reflecting my mind in its fragments that will never , could never , should never be put back together .   I tell you that I love you and you lick your lips lasciviously , glittery glowing groaning lipstick coating the red pillows that earn you your precious dollars that you for some reason think I have . But I do n't want what you sink down to your knees to give . I want only your heart in turn , your affections hellbent and thus far successful on destroying me .   I 've beat you to the punch , though : the red of your lips seeping across my knuckles and down my hands as the mirror in front of us lie shattered , reflecting not our visage in whole , but our mind and heart which seek nothing but the comfort of your adoration .   We abandon me .  
There comes a time , possibly overtime , maybe in due time ... For us , it came in an instance after some time of being here .   We had been dragging our way through life , eyes constantly fixed to the ground . Only to rise from sea level when being asked questions . And yeah , we 'd respond . `` I 'm doing fine , Mom . '' Saying all but the truth .   The truth was we were never happy . Until that instance where the time came . It came and came , until it overcame our entire being and breathing and seeing and all that . In that instance , I was with us .   Bouncing thoughts traveled to all those around me as they bounced back . Conversations without words , an understanding without agreement . Smiles without force and a force without relent that flowed through my heart beat and finally overrode my mind .   I remember thinking during that instance , `` man , this is funny ! '' Meanwhile , everyone around me laughed , while someone told a funny story of a fish out of water . I laughed too and his story finished . `` That was a well told story , '' I thought and the rest of us clapped .   I thought of ways to describe this place were I met all of us . The ideas were great and made sense while there , but now I can not describe it to you . We were so happy . We were all so there . In time . Inside . In us .   But I can not describe this thing about us . To you , at least .
I 've never been able to quite explain how I can see how long people will live , it shows up above their heads . For many years of my life I was called insane for telling people , so I stopped . Eventually everyone kind of forgot about it . During college I became friends with the popular kids and I after about a year I was invited to the biggest party of the year about 200 people showed up and we all drank like there was no tomorrow . After I had downed about 6 beers I looked around and noticed that everyone around me had 15 minutes left to live , I naturally assumed It was the same for me . So in my drunken state I started running , on my way out I bumped into some exposed pipe and I guess it was loose , because it broke . I was running for what seemed like 15 minutes and I suddenly heard a deafening boom from behind me . The house I was in minutes ago had exploded in a giant fiery ball .     Note : So this is my first WP , I decided to just see if I could do well .   Constructive Criticism and Tips are appreciated
`` Okay is there any way we can negotiate slightly on some of the terms ''   The faces at the table all looked at him with blank , confused stares . Himmler and Goebbels exchanged concerned looks .   `` Mein Fuhrer , this was the plan that you devised . We have already begun to implement it ''   Shit . Hitler 's mind raced desperately trying to think of a way out of the situation . His actions alone could save or condemn millions . If only he had n't tried to be the hero in the first place none of this would be happening .   `` Look its just that , maybe I have been slightly over zealous . I think we should put the brakes on the plan for now . I mean thinking about it camps might not be the best idea ''   The room was silent .   `` Now bare with me , why do n't we and this is just voicing an idea , leave the jews alone ''   `` Mein Fuhrer are you completely serious ? ''   `` Yes , I 've made my mind up ''   It was flimsy , it was poorly worded but under the circumstances he could think of nothing else to say . He had gone from been Jack Silas , time travelling vigilante to one of the biggest war criminals of all time in a matter of days . That did n't leave much time for careful planning .   The assembled Nazi 's looked at one another before Himmler spoke up .   `` Thank god for that ''
I 've been working in the Punchline Bar for 6 months now , I love my job , but this gimmicks gon na lead to the murder suicide of an entire pub !   I 'm getting used to my job now , but 6 O clock every day one of these situations happens and everyone turns and looks at me while I rack my brains for the bloody punchline !   Anyway , last night , a Jew , a Hindu and an Eskimo walked in and I got ta tell ya , I was fucked , the whole place grinds to a halt as everyone turns as one to stare at me as I rack my poor addled brain for the line .   Time has no meaning now , the air turns to treacle , the earth slows down and I stand there with sweat pouring off me .   Then , it comes to me . Like those three little drips when you think its all over , like nailing a perfect reverse park , like your childs first steps , like your favourite band striking up your favourite song in the encore , like a wish that comes true ... ...   'What a culturally diverse community we live in ' ! .   And the world spins on again , and I return to my stack of barman joke books ... .    
I was born into a world toxic from war . There lay on the wastelands a fortress , solitude for all of mankind . A ten by ten cell I call home contains no more then my bed , a few rations and a pen and paper to keep me occupied .   I 've been on this planet for 18 years and thanks to the generations before me I shall not step foot on it 's soil nor eat the fruit it bares . I 've only ever heard stories of what this planet resembled before the war . Some days I wonder if life behind these walls is worth living at all .   There are few things to do in here to pass time . No rooms are big enough to be active and I 'm not a very social person . I 've been told I have trouble communicating with others . It 's mostly because I do n't like anybody . I do n't even like myself . I do n't understand how anyone can in these conditions . I explore the seemingly endless , repetitive , crowded halls to pass time . It 's not a great pastime . But it 's better then sitting in a ten by ten all day .   While exploring today I came across a dark empty room . There was something different about this room , something eerie . The floors were stained red . Inside was only a tiny safe . On the door of the safe read `` exit '' . It is n't locked . Inside , a gun . I took it and pulled the trigger .
And it was old ! Like , before printing press old . Maybe even older than most religious works . Didn ’ t stop me from trying to read it though . Notice the word ‘ trying ’ ? Cause it was terrible ! Almost unreadable and also damn wordy . Turned out the book was about tricks . Can you imagine ? Tricks ! Like them people didn ’ t have anything better to worry about back in the day . Wait , I ’ ll give you a few examples of random chapters :   **There ’ s something on your tunic**   In the first part of this chapter it is explained how to convince someone that there ’ s something on their clothes . ‘ It ’ could be anything ranging from a stain to a fluff . The second part is on how to best flick someone ’ s nose if they fall for it and look down .   **Ask the other parent**   A chapter about how children can always go to the other parent if one has already said no .   **Tap on the wrong shoulder**   Pretty self-explanatory , right ?   **Pull my finger**   Yeah…   This goes on and on . So , yeah , to be very honest , trying to decipher this book was a waste of time . I already knew everything that was inside , being a pretty advanced prankster myself . If anyone is interested though , I made a short video on the book ’ s contents you can watch [ here ] ( https : //www.youtube.com/watch ? v=dQw4w9WgXcQ ) .  
As he spun around I saw the blur of black that extended from his hand . I was confused , but not afraid . I did not have time for fear . I just reacted . The impact of each step resonated through my body and time slowed down .   One , Two . I turned on my heels and started to run .   Three , Four . A second passes . There is hope .   Five . My world exploded . A chasm ripped through my back as I was torn apart .   Six . I began to fall forward .   As I fell , the light faded away and the world went quiet . It was like the sun was setting very rapidly and everyone had stopped to watch . A black world engulfed me . I imagined my family and my old friends flash past me . Then a point of light appeared , it expanded , engulfed me . I jolted awake in a room I knew . It was my room from my childhood .   Outside the door I heard voices . Voices I knew . Voices I had not heard for years .   I was confused , but not afraid .
It was subtle , at first . Flattened grass , trodden dirt patches , the occasional scurrying feet of some furry critter underneath . All in all nothing out of the ordinary . But then some of his belongings started moving around . He would come home to find his utensils scattered about his counter , or one of his many flower pots shattered on the ground , to which he would respond by cursing and kicking up a literal dust storm in a vain attempt at cleaning up the fertilizer . Still he did n't worry . He figured his ex-wife had been sneaking around , having devised some elaborate prank to get him back , but being the stubborn gentleman he was , his response was to simply ignore her . He would be the better man . And so it continued . Broken picture frames and dishes , pots and pans knocked off his kitchen walls , his pantry door thrown open with all of his food spilling out . And he would pick everything up and put them back in place . Until one evening he came home from one of his many jaunts through the woods and it was all gone . All of it . Not just the utensils , the flower pots , the pans , but his entire house .   Perhaps he should n't have parked his trailer on top of a hill .
The worst kind of fear is the fear that comes out of nowhere . No suspenseful music to foreshadow the villain jumping from behind the cabinet . No eerie atmosphere to put you in the paranoid mindset . For all intents and purposes , this kind of fear is not fear at all , but a sense of sudden inevitable nothingness .   You are standing on a pier on a beautiful summer day . Temperature wise it 's the most comfortable you 've been all year ; there is a lazy breeze that winds its way up your bare arms , squeezing you close . Birds singing creates a melancholy symphony which upholds the bold nature of the day . You smell lakewater , aromatic to the point of sickness . But you 're used to that scent by now , so the algae and the fish mingle in your sinuses , doing a tango .   Without so much as a ripple for warning , an enormous fish shudders from the depths of the lake , its bottom jaw ripping through the pier behind you . You try to run forward but a row of magnificently sharp teeth impede any forward motion . A snap of the jaws later , you 're in darkness . Whole , totally encapsulating darkness .   You wake up drenched in sweat , out of breath and crying .
-emperors sanctum-   *clik* Reincarnation Detected . *clik clik* Extrapolating Location *clik*   Long tendrils extend towards the console as it flickers to life , the creatures body quivers with anticipation as it strikes the floating orbs in rapid succession . Several holographic images appear around the room . Representatives from life forms of varying genetic superiority , yet all evolved enough to stand here . More continue to arrive with every passing second , hundreds , thousands .

Personally I don ’ t feel like the sticky today is an issue . I haven ’ t been here long but it ’ s the first I ’ ve seen since I started lurking like… December 2nd or something . I liked that he admitted that it was going to sound conceited . He could ’ ve just covered it up with a shit ton of smilies .   “ Some people have taken to pinging me on prompts they would like to see me work on , I recommend everyone does it ! : D : D : D : D : D ” as opposed to honesty ? I ’ ll take the honesty , honestly .   Also , I think that if he didn ’ t link to his subreddit , then I would ’ ve found myself pretty frustrated . Dude just said he was KNOWN for certain things he ’ s written , but he isn ’ t going to follow up by putting out his writing ? Well , that ’ s just silly .   Just relax : ) it ’ s not like it ’ s the only thing on the front page , my friend .

What the hell ? What is going on ? Is this some kind of sick joke ? I ... I ... is this even possible ? I looked around the barren land , where my house once stood . Shock and disbelief submerged my being , I had never experienced something so strange . My house had vanished , the space was now nothingness . Empty . Void . How do I start over ? Where do I begin ? I do n't know what to do . I cried out with fear and abandonment . Unsure of myself , was I still dreaming ? Or was I going mad ?   I ran around frantically , searching all over town . I visited every corner of my world , but my home was nowhere . I asked everyone that I passed if they knew something , anything , but I was only met with blank stares . Did no one understand the severity of this ? All of my belongings , gone . All of my history , gone . I felt hopeless . Lost .   I guess the only thing to do now was to start new . Fresh . Maybe this was a good thing ? A blessing in disguise . Yes , that 's it . Today is the first day in a new chapter of my life . I stared out into the vast emptiness , wondering what my next move was going to be when I spotted something familiar in the distance .   Wait . Oh never mind , there 's my box . My owner must 've moved it . Phew . I hopped in , curled up and purred myself back to sleep .
I dare say there has hardly been a man more of note than Mister John .   He was an upstanding sort . Even though some might view it as pedophilic , He loved children . He sponsored and took in many an orphan , and though the pop-media might say he had other intentions for the young persons ... well ... it simply was n't true . Mister John was a philanthropist through and through .   It would be unfair to call his life unfair growing up . He was a child of the upper middle class , born and raised in the suburbs . He attended church and even a youth group through high school . He worked with local do-gooders and raised money to help inter city children , \ .   By all accounts He was on track to receive People Magazine 's person of the year award .   Mister John had just finished a phenomenal interview with People Magazine , and the writer of the review was editing his work ; making sure the commas were in the correct locations and such , and he decided to check his email .   The details are a bit crass , but what the Editor received , caused him to reveal that Mister John had been running a child labor trade with Somalia   .
November 6th .   Well , shit .   Today has got to have been the eeriest day of my life . Imagine walking outside your front door , picking up the paper , sipping your coffee , expecting today to just be yet another Monday , then realizing that it 's dead silent . No hustle . No bustle . Nothing . I feel like the earthworm that Noah forgot about and accidentally trod on . At first , it kinda seemed like the world was playing a prank on me . Like at any moment , everyone will re-appear and shout , `` SURPRISE , '' and everything will return to the miserable bliss that I once suffered from . But then , it hit me . Everyone is gone . No rules , no regulations , nobody to tell me right from wrong . So I did what anybody else would do . I walked down to the cemetery , and pissed on my father . Then I smashed the bank , just based on the sheer principle of lawlessness . Then I walked to the White House , and sat in the oval office . I wondered if I could nuke Russia from here , my feet scuffing the table and everything . And then it hit me again .   Everyone was gone .
The race was decided six years before my birth . So I tell myself , though I know it 's only part of the truth . He always took a greater interest in the running of things . I always was looking at the world beyond the curtain of trees that ran past the swamps to keep the privacy of the farm from the road . He was fixing machinery when I was in school . I was pulling weeds on another man 's plot when he was learning to make sales . I can not blame crude nepotism alone , though surely more enthusiasm went to the healthy first-born 's tutelage than to bringing the last son , prone to peculiarities of the mind , into the fold . It is only natural .   I will go- leave the land that I have no claim to , the landed class that I have no more place in . Like my father once did , and like my friends do now , I will work the land of others , and bring forth fruits for them , to earn the lesser part of all my labor 's worth . The sweat of my brow will nurture new holdings and build new inheritances for new heirs . If fortune smiles , I may one day build for myself some measure of greater station . For the time , though , I will work . I hold no bitterness . I am denied nothing that I earned . There is no pain in second place .
It was simple really , just light and sound . Humans have known for a long time that our perception of the universe helps mold us and our choices . What they hadn ’ t realized fully till now was that they could control that very input . Sure there has , for most of human history , been the simple science of propaganda , but with new discoveries the leaders realized they could not just influence what a person took in , they could control it completely .   The prototypes were huge monolithic monstrosities , highly obvious and quite expensive , with no way to deploy them to the battlefield . The higher ups kept pushing it , though , and the scientists found shortcuts , made enhancements , and economized it . Eventually it was the size and shape of a dodge ball , though it still weighed half a ton . This device would need a way to be seen and heard by all , so they attached them to large balloons .   The time had finally come , the almighty leader gave the order and the ‘ bug-eyed balls ’ , so the troops called them after their peculiar look , were set loose over enemy territory . After waiting a few days for the effects to occur , we marched in wearing specially designed helmets that filtered certain frequencies , and encountered no resistance . It was a complete success . The enemy populace had been turned into raving lunatics and lifeless dolls . No blood was shed . A harmless and painless way had been realized to bring peace to the entire world .

Who would have thought that something so simple could fuck up my entire relationship in more ways than one ? ! .   Honestly ,   everything was perfect , I saw myself to be a somewhat handsome fellow ,   with what I once believed to be a rather adept dick giving ability .   I did however , get reminded regularly that I was pushing above my `` weight grade '' , which upon second thought was also a likely stab at the few kgs I may have put on over the past few months ,   But , can you blame me , it was winter & burritos are fucking delicious .   In all seriousness though how I ended up with a girl like this I will never know , It seems Yaggermeister and poor lighting the night we met created a version of me that left her moist and wanting , A feeling I very much wish too revive .   This is how one simple act that at the time I considered considerate , had her reconsider everything she once thought of me .   There is but one thorn i must tear from deep inside her if this relationship is to spark anew .   I will destroy that dildo , if its the last dil I do .     To be continued ...  
*Knock knock*   Jane scrambled from her bed and steeled herself against the wall , clutching at her breast . `` Who 's there ? '' she squeaked . It was closing in on eleven o'clock .   `` Doctor , '' came the reply .   Jane whimpered . She knew this day was coming . What was the correct response . Who or whom ?   There had been a `` Doctor '' let loose in her neighbourhood who was there to cleanse the area of bad grammar . However , recently someone had been touting themselves as another `` Doctor '' to cleanse the area of grammar-snobs .   If it were Doctor Who then being grammatically correct would see her cleansed . If it were Doctor Whom , however , then remembering the joke of her childhood would cleanse her .   `` Doctor ... Doctor Who ? ''   Jane could hear him scratching and scraping at the lock . She screamed in terror and went into the hallway . As she entered she froze as a man in a cloak and top hat stood at her front door . He raised his arm in front of him .   *BANG*   `` Doctor Whom ''  
Salt pools in my mouth as the tears make their descent down my face , I ’ m gasping for air as my body attempts to sob one last time . I don ’ t let it . I dare myself to look up and there they are , derision plain on their faces as they look down at me . One of them plays with her hair as a smile slowly spreads across her face .   “ Oh , I think he ’ s done . Are you done ? Or should we call your Mommy ? ”     I wipe the snot off of my face and stare defiantly back into her blue eyes , but she doesn ’ t flinch , even at ten years old her eyes hold more power than any teacher . I know now that this is my only opportunity . A growl escapes my mouth , surprising even me , and I shoot up from the ground . My hands meet her shoulders with a satisfying thud and she pinwheels her arms , trying to prevent the inevitable . When her butt hits the dirt I start to run , the expanse of the playground stretching out before me as I flee . She might be crying now , but I know that I will never cry again .  
No one could explain it : not my parents , my doctors , even people who had studied the field of shadows their entire lives understood me . Its strange to have no charater . You 'd expect me to be a vegetable , without conciousness , locked within their own tormented mind for eternity ; at least , thats what **they** thought .   I was a global wonder . “ The man with no shadow ! ” they 'd scream . At first it was in awe and curiosity . Then in resentment and bigotry . “ The man with no shadow. ” they 'd say : only in muttered tones , whispering to each other .   I mean , its not like I 'm bad . Fuck , I 've seen people with horrors mirrored in the darkness that lies behind them . They 're no angel either , far from it . But still ... They 're not me are they .   My story is not one of a man who had a unique power and was able to save the world . Save that one for the childrens books . No . My story shows the human nature for what it truly is . They 're inability to see past what they see and coexist . The ignorance of difference . The bigotry of the mass ...   This was found in Andrew Sharpen 's desk . Alongside his hanging body he left this note . Whether they learn from it , is their choice .   Andrew Sharpen 1985 - 2001   End   THIS WAS WRITTEN ON MOBILE , PLEASE EXCUSE FORMATTING ISSUES .
Took another aproach , calling someone who has feelings at the wrong time out on it . God , how can you be so stupid ? ! It took me leaving you , being completely happy with someone who has always known he loves me , and a whole summer apart for you to realize what you had ? What you lost and let slip away for good ? Yes , I know you love me now . All of our friends know too , even your sister . My love knows it , and I think he 's scared that I could somehow reciprocate the feelings you have . That 's fucking done . I thought once I was starting to even love you back then . Your cold bitter denial and insults drove me away and stomped out any chances of us ever being together . I need to buy you a pair of dark sunglasses as soon as possible . Thats what attracted me in the first place ... your perfectly stunning blue eyes and the way the pupils dilate like crazy if I do anything feminine or bold . Those eyes still call to me sometimes , its why I cant bear to see you every single day . I dont even understand what you could see in me . Theres nothing here , just a big ass , straggly ginger hair , and a basicly flat chest . Its only because you dont talk to any other girls . Someday we will both just have to move past all of this , though I doubt it will end well .
Dear mom ,   I miss you . You do n't know how hard it is to stay away from you but yet that 's what you requested . I 'm sorry for the stupid things I did in my adolescence . I was so angry at him and I took it out on all of you . I wish I could take it all back . I wish you could look over our differences like I have come to and remember all the good times . It used to be just you and me against the world before he came into the picture . He changed you . But this letter is n't to tell you what you did wrong . It 's about me . I did you wrong on so many things I let my anger control me and I said things that I knew would cut you deep down and I 'm so sorry . Please forgive me . I wish I could see you . I wish I could see my brother . I do n't know what things you told him about me but I wish he did n't hate me so strongly . Please mom ... I need you . I love you . Even still .   With love and regret   Your daughter
I 'd been looking at him for 10 full seconds before I realised that I had n't taken a breath since he 'd walked in . My gaze tracked his progress to the counter as the sound of rushing blood filled my ears . He was hypnotising me just by existing in this small space .   He turned to scan the coffee shop for an empty table and I barely managed to close my mouth before the turn of his head reached my position . A flush of heat coloured my cheeks and I looked away quickly , just a split second too late . I studiously examined the book open in front of me but I was n't absorbing anything . My whole body was tuned into him , knowing where he was . I heard his voice and then his footsteps growing closer and my heart fluttered in my chest .   My eyes closed , not daring to look at him in case I had imagined him , dreamed him to life .   A chair scraped the floor . A cup was placed on a table with a clink of porcelain on granite .   `` Is this seat taken ? ''   I jumped , looking up at him far too quickly . Speechlessly , I shook my head and watched him take the seat opposite me . The blood that was n't colouring my cheeks fled south , throbbing heat in my sex .   He smiled and I fell in love .
Its been over 2 years . We are still married but its something of a bad memory for you . Its a dream for me . I still hope that one day you will want to be a family one day . I dont know when it will be or if i will still be here to do that . I want that love that we once had . The love we promise each other when we got married . But to you it ran out . To me it still strong . Wberytime isee you it all come flashing back and i see hope in your beauty . But to you im just another person and its hard not to say anything . But over time ive grown stronger to tje point where i can hide it . To where i can completely be inept to the love i have for you . But every day and every night i think of you even though i know you think of someone else . Im just a long memory in your past . A mistake . You werent ky mistakr . You were my one good thing . But i cant say it , because it will just oush you that much furthur . I love you Meagan . I really do , just day the word and you can walk back into my life where you left .
`` We must crush the impending segregation of robot and man , to create a united front against the forces of machine-ism ! `` , the robot cried out , causing a mass cheer . The synths raised their hands , shouting `` Victory ! '' .   It had gone on for about 3 years now . Since the dawn of the sentient machine , it has been burdened by the hardships of man . The hard working machine used in war , where he must be used as a shield for his meat-ridden comrades . Senseless beatings and burning of metal has implanted the smell of burning steel and titanium in the new millennium . `` Machine-ism '' , the racial pot of humans against robots based purely on how they look and their history as workbots , has stirred in the minds of the common folk for generations . Since the Apple uprising of 2212 , where a group of workbots overthrew a Apple plant in China to 2215 , where a militia of workbots attacked a armed convoy of Army soldiers in Iraq , many citizens have grown weary of them . The workbots , or what they would like to be named , `` synths '' , claim no hate for the humans .   The fight grows ever weary . A civil war of synths against humans will rise in the coming months .   Do you fight with the Synth Rights Republic ? Or the Human Worker Party ? Time will tell .
`` Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie . Charlie ? Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie , '' said the man .   `` Charlie Charlie Charlie . Charlie ! ! ! ! Oh Charlie Charlie . Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie . '' The nice lady put the plate on the floor . PELLETS ! My favorite . Nice lady is good lady .   `` Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie . Charlie ? Charlie ! Charlie ! '' said the fat boy . He smells like meat . Pull my tail , fat boy . See what happens .   `` Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie ? Charlie Charlie . Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie Charlie . '' The man swats the fat boy . YES ! One day I too will swat the fat boy . Oh shit ! Ball ! Ball ! Ball ! Ball ! Ball !   `` Charlie ! '' shouts the fat boy . Oh you did not just call me Charlie whoever the dick you are .   `` Look at that ! '' says the man . `` He 's finally learned his name , have n't you , *Charlie ? * You dumb piece of shit . ''   My ... wha -- JERKY TREAT !
The light blinded my eyes , forcing me look away for a second .   I could see Jake 's silhouette striding down the receiving teleporter node , he was walking towards me .   `` Hey Jake , you feeling fine ? '' I asked , his eyes were glowing red , probably just never noticed before though .   `` I HUNGER , FEED ME THE SOULS OF THE INNOCENT '' he bellowed in a suddenly deep voice , man , teleporting must have been more straining than I thought .   `` Wow , you are such a kidder Jake , anyway , we have to go to my octuplet niece 's baptism , so just turn off the teleporter and we can be on our way .   He turned around to face the teleporter , extended his arm , and clenched his fist , the teleporter nodes immediately compressed into tiny silver cubes , that must be the surprise feature he kept alluding to .   `` MORTAL , LET US GO AND PARTAKE ON THIS 'BAPTISM ' YOU MENTIONED '' he bellowed again , man , he has to get his ears checked .   `` Sure thing Jake , just follow me '' man , this is going to be the best baptism ever !  
Oh Yukon gold of the glittering expanse ,   a miner 's Big Rock Candy Mountain ,   there for the stars to watch --   an asteroid belt now cast as fortune 's fountain .   A slingshot of promise ,   a trip to the comets :   Tethered to a carbon-fiber dream   and edging toward that heavenly seam ,   they boarded vessels and rockets ,   we kissed rabbit feet and lockets ,   we cried to any gods and goddesses   for providence , for the odds of it .   But the landing gear proved stiff ,   so they prepared for the homeward trip .   `` There 's no shame in dying ,   but this is n't worth trying . ''   We sigh , we call it a worthy   but expensive test ,   a trip up the beanstalk   to glimpse the giant 's best .   But a spaceship loaded with heavenly treasure   lists and tumbles as though death were its pleasure .   From our living rooms we watched the scratch in the sky ,   the line of smoke marking a noble dream die .   But we devised new vessels and ships with results unchanged .   We dared again into the heavens with heart-bound pains .   Another mission , another line of empty coffins --   but promise of fortune is a promise that beckons often .   And in the silvering reds of sunset ,   we buried the memory of my brother ,   an asteroid miner , ambitious and brave .   While that old Yukon prayer filled his grave .   Calm and through tears ,   my father whispered ,   looking broken ,   but standing tall :   `` At first they came   back with nothing ,   and then they did n't   come back at all . ''
A brisk wind howled through the abandoned halls of the former admin building . Outside in the /r/all open park , the trojan pizza trucks that had been used to destroy the barricades burned . /r/Random_Acts_Of_Pizza had secretly been infiltrated by the shadowmob . Slithering into their back channels using throwaways , and alts . When the shadowban war started they had unleashed holy hell on the admins using their attack pizza trucks . The admins had n't stood a chance .   Since the admin had fallen two weeks ago , the city had fallen into chaos . What had started out as securing ourselves against the shadowbanned had progressed to outright subreddit on subreddit battles . The first blow struck was between two adjoining neighborhoods . The good people of /r/Minecraft ave , and the people of /r/Terraria had finally come to blows . It was a quick but bloody fight with /r/minecraft annexing the smaller neighborhood .   This unleashed the floodgates . Subreddits that had previously only jelously eyed the OC of their similar neighbors now greedily invaded hoping to annex , or in some cases just steal .   The fabled museum halls of /r/aww were ransacked , and pillaged . their great works of art scattered to the rancid winds .   The marble columns of /r/todayilearned were splashed with the freshly spilled blood of the invaders from /r/RepostForKarma . The broken bodies and tattered banners of both side being picked clean by scavengers from /r/centuryclub , desperate for any karma they could find .
This is what I get for being an atheist . Guess I really am the asshole . You have to understand though , I had every reason not to believe in a higher power . Let 's list them shall we ?   1 . My junkie bitch mother kills my dad in his sleep because the PCP told her he was a zombie .   2 . My aunt and uncle ( who took me in post-patricide ) were n't completely honest on their taxes when they said they had only three dependents . Turns out a kid neither I nor their other kids had ever met was kept locked up in a crawl space in their basement . I thought a squirrel was trapped . Imagine my surprise when I investigated .   3 . I endured group home after group home after my aunt and uncle were sent to jail . Great way to learn about anger and depression .   4 . Joined the Army and got a leg blown off in Afghanistan for my trouble .   5 . While being shipped home after said amputation , everybody else on the transport disappears . Just poof , gone . I grab a chute , bail out , and land I 'm not sure where .   So to God or Allah or who-the-fuck-ever runs the universe : thank you . And fuck you for thinking this is a punishment for me . You think this is bad ? At least there 's nobody else around to ruin my day .
I always loved the smell of fresh books . Old ones and new ones , sacred ones and graphic ones . I loved books . It was obvious to me that I should be a librarian .   I always dreamed of it . The silence , with only occasional whispers to shank the pure serenity .   When the posting came up on Craigslist I was ecstatic . `` LIBRARIAN FOR HIRE . NO EXPERIENCE NEEDED ''   The interview was simple . But I was a little nervous beforehand .   As I sat there in the waiting rooms uncomfortable chair I had to use the restroom . I went and did my business and stared into the mirror .   I could n't get the germs off my hands . I had to get them off . I could n't .   My hands started to bleed . I went into my suit jacket and grabbed a bottle of Xanax .   The books being out of line ? It does n't bother me .   `` Not alphabetical ? '' Oh well .   None of it bothers me , but everyone keeps complaining about the blood in the books . That I 'm sick of hearing .
As usual I am late for the meeting . It starts exactly at five , ironically in a room where all this began . It is in this exact spot they came for the prediction . That is all history now .   When I opened the door , I saw a few chairs were vacant and they have already started the meeting . A new guy was sharing his experience .   `` Well I had this notion that it would be a scary place . But surprisngly it was not . It is all so ... . common . But it is a type of common you hate . Like how long you have wait at a supermarket counter , how your TV is filled with shit you do not even want to know and so on .   You think it would get over now , but it does n't , it goes on for hours and hours and days and months , and you get so fed up by that . And that is when the anger kicks in . If you are not angry you are sad . And trust me that is the worst there is .   You are depressed if you are sad . You could kill yourself a thousand times over and you can not die . I stared torturing and that is how I made it. ``   I can hear his voice breaking up . Any minute now , he will cry . He thinks it all happened , and it takes a long time to understand that none of this ever happend .   I sat at my chair and gazed at my scarred wrists .
I 'm sorry I could n't be there to see you grow up but this is for the best . I want to leave you with the same advice my mother gave me in her suicide note .   You 'll need :   3 pounds 75 lean ground beef   2 pounds of something lean I 'd suggest a calve but its your choice .   2 tblspn kosher salt   1 tblspn ground black pepper   1 tblspn marjoram   2 tblspn granulated onion   2 tblspn ground celery seed   1 1/2 tsp ground nutmeg   1/2 tsp cardamon   1/2 tsp mace   1/2 tsp ground ginger   1 cup ice water   Force meat through 3/16 '' grinder .   Pour spices in small container and mix with ice water .   Poor spice water into ground meat , mix thoroughly with hands .   Refrigerate for 8 hours .   Grind mixture once more through fine grind plate .   Stuff the sausage immediately into 1 1/4 inch natural hog casing .   Air dry an hour then refrigerate . If you freeze them I should last for 3 months .   When cooking simmer in beer for ten minutes then brown on the grill .   Sauerkraut and mustard , absolutely . No . Ketchups !   Love you , sorry about the mess .
You know what I fucking hate ? When my mom says “ You kids all think you ’ re invincible at this age. ” Are you kidding me ? Do you know just how many nights I lay awake , thinking about my funeral ? I ’ m young , not stupid .   Now some of these kids at school , they can be kinda stupid . I guess that ’ s why it took me so long to find friends . And why it took me so long to find Bryce . Bryce is the name you ’ d give a 12 year old punk who flips his skateboard in your face and chokes on cigarette smoke . But Bryce himself wasn ’ t that bad . He had wavy brown hair and almost only wore T-shirts from soccer or the school plays .   So this one night , after play practice , Bryce grabbed me by the arm and pulled me out to his car . We drove out to the far side of town , where the speed limit is 55 mph and only people who can afford new cars every year live . And we drove up and down the roads , singing to the radio , and finally slumped back into town at 11pm . Then he drove off . And he didn ’ t come to school the next day . And when he did come back , he looked tired . And his family moved to Denver a month later .   We were immortals , just not for very long .  
`` Well he was pretty unimportant ... .. right ? '' Bob asked .   `` Do you even listen to the shit that comes out of your mouth ? '' the Angel asked incredulously .   `` What the fuck to you mean by that ? Anyway who cares about if there is a God for Monday anymore I mean honestly . ''   Immediately the room felt small as the Angel spoke again . `` You have set in motion a something that will ripple though all of time . Without Mondays be the sacred day of hate in the week it will lead to the unraveling of the entire social order of humanity as all of that is spread throughout the week no more enjoying any day even the weekends . '' roared the Angel . `` You have upset the cosmic order and will now be blamed for the consequences for the rest of history . ''   `` Ok well that does n't seem so bad , and plus I can think of at least one person who wo n't mind '' Bob said .   `` Oh really who ? ''   `` Garfield of course . '' Bob replied with a smile .
Rarely had a phrase ever popped into my mind that so clearly demonstrated a fellow human 's insignificance . The senseless debate had jumped from politics , to religion , to science , and here was a man who had the credibility from others , but not the actual knowability of someone deserving credibility . Perhaps it was his nonchalant response of `` I do n't read books '' or his refutal of the scientific method . Thinking back to my fellow predecessors whom I shared no blood with , I wondered what they would do in this situation . Would they walk away ? Would they deficate on them ?   The conversation abruptly ended as follows   `` Look bro , in the end , all that science offers , and all that math offers is useless , and nobody will care about it in the long run . Its irrelevant and that is fact , you dont even have to think about ... . ''   ( my mind drifted wondering . I need something big , sudden , but that will linger , and he will remember for the rest of his life )   `` CRAWL BACK UP YOUR MOM 'S PUSSY YOU DUMB MOTHERFUCKER , AND FIND YOUR BRAIN UP IN THAT SPIDERWEB YOU DISGUSTING PEICE OF AMPHIBIAN SHIT ''   Silence , was all that could be heard , and he promptly walked away . The audience applauded
The mist thinned again without releasing its biting cold . The temple screamed with unearthly resonance . The acropolis echoed with the splashing of blood dripping from the sealing . Sunset allayed a sparse effulgence , orange and blue upon blood-soaked marble . In my hands was now a choice , to take the blackened chalice and run towards the shadows moving in the mist , or break my oath to god and drink . Death was not an option any longer . My brothers impaled upon the sealing cried out to me . Hundred writhing in pain upon blackened jagged pikes . I caught their blood ; it was the only water to be had . The mist thickened . I drank .   my mind cleared , I saw more than shadows , I saw faces in the mist , eyes , and fear . the chalice crumbled to ash in my hands . The holy grail undone . an immortal born in folly . cursed with a lust for blood unending . I let out a roar , for I knew my fate . in the crowd I saw Mephistopheles smile , he stepped forward and embraced me with open arms . they never could have touched the grail . my faith was too weak : but such is his design .

`` This shit is bananas ''   He held up a small brown cube .   `` I 'm sorry , what ? ''   `` This energy source , that everyone 's been talking about . The one that 's more efficient than coal . It 's literally just bananas . ''   `` Ordinary bananas ? ''   `` Yeah , completely ordinary bananas ''   He stared out the window of the office , 20 stories about ground in the Exxon Mobile headquarters   `` How did we miss it ? For years we 've been searching for a cheap renewable energy source that can be burnt in an ordinary gas tank . ''   `` Do n't beat yourself up ''   `` It was right there . I 'd have bananas every single breakfast . And somehow I missed it ''   `` How did you find out ? ''   `` The guys in the lab analyzed Shell 's new PowerPellets last week . Sent the results over this morning . It 's just bananas that have been freeze-dried and ground up . No additives , chemicals or anything . Just bananas . And it provides pound for pound more energy than natural gas . ''   `` Well.. what are we going to do ? ''   `` Orange ''   `` Excuse me ? ''   `` Orange you glad i did n't say banana ? ''   `` I do n't understand , Sir . ''   `` It was a joke , Alfred ''   `` Oh ... hehe.. very funny , Sir ''
He lets one rip . Not a huge one , just loud enough that me seated next to him and already bored , staring off into space am the only person who seems to notice .   I can see him discretely looking around to see if anyone heard . Our eyes meet , he knows I know . I smile to try and let him know it 's ok. His cheeks turn just slightly pink in an instant and he gives me an awkward half smile while simultaneously turning back to the front of the room and averting my gaze .   I did n't mind , I 'm not such a prude that I do n't find such things funny and innocent . I did n't really think much of it ever again to be honest .   He spends the rest of the year making sure our eyes never meet , he talks to the guy on his other side whenever necessity calls for communicating with another student and he seems to rush out of the room with his head down at every bell . That one emission and subsequent meeting of eyes served to be our lone communication .   It 's a shame really , I thought he was kinda cute .
`` Aaaaaaaaaaaaand we 're back , '' the bearded gameshow host crooned into the cameras `` with our final contestant , who has beat all the odds to make it to the final round . '' The rules had been pretty simple up until this point ; answer the question right , get through the obstacle course , stuff as many marshmallows as possible into my mouth , etc . But this was the season finale ... and it was sweeps week . I knew they were going to throw me some sort of curveball , but I had no idea it 'd be this contrived . Before me , on the dias surrounded by cameras and a live studio were three doors .   `` And beyond one of these doors infernal , lies the secret to happiness eternal , '' the old man gestured smoothly .   The crowd ooh 'd and aah 'd at the command of the prompter . They hushed again as the old man 's suspenseful tones filled the room again .   `` Beyond one of the doors in your sight , are endless answers to questions infinite . ''   The crowd ahh 'd and then ooh 'd this time , loudly enough to be picked up by the in-studio microphones , but not too loudly so that the campy gameshow theme music could n't be heard .   `` But beyond door the third , again lies treasures before unheard . ''   A hush fell over the crowd , as the host again turned to me .   `` So , which will it be ? ''   I do n't remember much after that , but I guess my curiosity got the better of me .   All I know now is that I have a goat .
`` And here we are , using this magical thing called an *aeroplane* . It flies using a rare alchemical compound called 'jet fuel ' . My suitcase ( packed to the brim , of course , with magic defences , just in case of emergency ) is put away in something called a 'drawer ' .   `` I managed to get on to the plane using a picture of me and some of my blood . Now , do n't worry , wizards , because it 's all in here . Wait , it 's not- now , where did I put it ? A-ha ! It 's in my suitcase . Back in a moment . ''   `` There we are ! And as we can see , that , is a small picture of my face imprinted in this , and it has something incredible , called a 'biometric chip , ' which contains all my data on it . I 'm currently flying to ... hang on a second . There we go ! Afghanistan , to a place called Kabul . ''   `` Join me next time for a trip down into this Kabul place . ''
[ Idea 2 ]   I was sat on my bed with my friend , talking about the colors . We had been talking about it during our sex ED class .     `` Yea , apparently it happens you touch your soulmate ! I ca n't wait to see it ! '' I exclaim , smiling widely .     `` I do n't see the big deal , everything 's pretty different now . Like I do n't see how people are n't seeing the difference between orange and yellow I mean.. It 's pretty different ! ''     I stare at them , `` What do you mean , they 're nearly the same shade ! ''     They stare at me , `` No ? ''     I gasp , `` I think you can see the colors . ''     `` But how ? I 'm not touching anyone ! I 've never had that sudden 'wowie zowie difference ! ' ''     I pull out my phone and begin to research it . I find an article about it .     `` Aromantic people are born with the colors , due to their lack of a soulmate . They do not fall in love with anyone , due to not wanting a romantic relationship . '' I read aloud .     `` ... There 's a word for that ? '' They asked , `` I thought it was just because I 'm still young ... Holy shit . ''     `` I 'm so jealous ! You have the colors already ! That must be amazing ! ''     ( I have an aromantic friend and was wondering what it would do to aro people . )
I sat down at the dining table one early morning eating my breakfast when I noticed my daughter come down the stairs in her pajamas with a blanket in tow . She told my wife and I good morning as she rubbed her eyes and sat down at the table .   As we ate breakfast the T.V . was on in the den with the morning news playing as usual . The flashy news graphics came up and the news anchor started to speak .   `` World government officials and meeting for the annual feast held in Jerusalem to celebrate the twentieth anniversary of the ending of the AI war . ''   I looked across into the den from the table and could see all the dignitaries shaking hands . I looked back down at my food when I heard my daughter speak up .   `` Daddy , what did you do in the AI War ? ''   My wife looked over at her .   `` Now Daisy , lets not ask Daddy about that . ''   `` It 's okay . '' I said to my wife . `` Well Daisy , Daddy was what they call an Infiltrator . ''   She looked at me with a strange face .   `` What does an ... that word do ? ''   `` Well , Daddy would fly a very small plane and we would land them where the AI 's computers were and would break them . ''   She gave me another funny look before smiling .   `` Okay Daddy . '' she said as she continued eating her breakfast . I was glad she stopped asking questions . My wife looked at me and could tell I was uncomfortable , but I was going to be fine .
I pulled over to the side of the road , my proximity sensors warning of passing cars as the flashing lights of a police cruiser reflected into my eyes from the rear view like some JJ Abrams movie . I rolled down my window and put my hands on the wheel , an odd thing these days to have to touch it at all . The smell of pending rain blew into the car and I knew it was going to be a big storm . All the more reason to not trust my car to get me home once it started .   The officer strutted up to the vehicle , her hand on her sidearm and the other with her thumb through a belt loop .   `` Sir , are you aware that your OS has been overridden in this vehicle ? ''   `` Yes ma'am I am . ''   `` You know that 's against the law . ''   `` Yes ma'am I do , but there are exceptions when the life of the driver is at risk from the OS . ''   `` You some kind of lawyer ? ''   `` No ma'am , I 'm a programmer . In fact I write the software that runs these cars , including yours . ''   `` So what 's wrong with this one that you had to take the OS offline ? ''   `` I was downloading an update through Comcast and still had to get home before the federal curfew . ''   `` Carry on . ''     Edit : Thanks for the gold .
Seven Years , i cant believe its been seven years . The scientists at Harvard finally created a program to open the mysterious file , that was sent to the entire world .   It feels like so long ago , my email it was sent to was pussydestroyer69691 @ yahoo.com a email i made when i just entered high school .   The Emailists were created because of the email and they believe that the email holds the details of the end of times .   No one knows where it came from . It just says blank @ blank.com a website that does n't exist and forwards the webpage to porn , lots and lots of porn .   This morning when the program was released , chaos broke lose , the emailists were behind the riots trying to stop people from opening the email because it is `` Knowledge only the admin should know . ''   I hid in my apartment the moment the news broke out , and the power was out from the riots . So i took out my android and went on yahoo . Every ad on the page was about avoiding looking at the email and some even went as far to threaten me .   I enter my username and password , and stare at the email debating in my head if i should open it . In one swift click i open the file , it shows one message   LOL I FUCKED YOUR MOM LAST NIGHT VIRGIN   I through my phone at the wall hearing it smash and i though to myself , '' how does he know im a virgin ? ''
I remember it as if it was today , when I was writing a post on a subreddit called writing prompts . It all started when one day , I was just sitting down enjoying a hot cup of cocoa , when all of a sudden my friend suggested that I visit this subreddit known as writing prompts . As I began to become more familiar with the prompts on this subreddit I began to write multiple stories . And that is when it happened , as I continued to scroll down a list of prompts I noticed one that said `` ... .And that 's how I discovered I was famous on the Internet '' . Automatically my nervous system sent me a message through my synapses , this was the writing prompt where I would become famous . So of course like any other human beings I began to write a vivacious story to answer a writing prompt . To my surprise my suspicions where correct all of a sudden the red upvote button began to flash . It started at 1 then 2 then 3 then 4 and it kept going on until eventually it reached 8000 . My hands began to shake the numbers kept increasing and all of a sudden I began to realize my writing prompt was unlike any other . And that my friends is how I discovered I was famous on the Internet .
There he is again . Rumbling through the warehouse , smashing crates like a caveman . Every time he comes he causes property damage in the millions . He has no sense of responsibility , just a brute with tons of luck . And he is not smart enough to see the big picture . Where was he when the country went in total economical collapse ? He stopped some poor man from robbing the high society . Little did he know that the kids of that poor man starved to death that very week . And he dares to oppose me . Calling me the unjust threat to mankind . Me , the man who single handedly employed thousands of people . Building the economy back brick by brick . I dont discriminate over race or social status . I offer the people that need help a job , a life and a purpose . And all that moron is doing is stealing the hopes of thousands of family 's . He is still smashing the big crates in hopes to find what he is looking for . He has no sense , no system , no logic , just brute force , a charming smile and a chest made of steel . Little does he know that she is n't in this warehouse . That idiot could never figure out a simple plan like this . And soon , my newest device might finally get rid of this imbesil and I will show the world how a true Utopia looks like .
Living things perform a dance of life before they perish ; each dance starts with a learning and playing to the eventual fighting and succeeding . Albeit this performance in all species is uniquely white & black , human beings with their gift of intellect can capture such a sensation - knowing there 's a dance even in the darkness . Such lament over loss and sacrifice can be placed into a tempo of ravenous thirst for surviving tooth-and-nail .   We 're also cruel creatures . We take it upon ourselves to be cruel to one another . To take from those weaker , to use our fallen as stepping stones to rise above . This sort of primal hierarchy is undoubtedly within us all . We enjoy the suffering of others , it is as sweet as poison . It is pleasurable to listen to as well .   Alas , a ballad written by a tortured soul with melodies by a children 's entertainer is ever so unlike one another . It 's masochism ! It 's a fetish ! A siren would take envy greener than any sea . The difference of course is ... you continue to dance .
The dry rustle of the palm leaves sapped at John 's unconsciousness , slowly bringing him back to his grim reality . He did n't need to open his eyes to remember his situation , a parched , hoarse throat was enough . `` I can survive another day '' he vowed , but by now this daily mantra brought no comfort .   Already the sun was climbing higher , bringing another day of oppressive heat . John stood and surveyed the bleak blue horizon which encircled him . For now he must worry about matters closer to him . He turned and faced the dense jungle of the island , concealing it 's inner secrets with an opaque green curtain .   As he entered the foliage the familiar uneasiness engulfed him again . It was only when John would emerge from this shroud of darkness that it would leave .   Wearily walking to the stream he wondered how long it would take for him to be forgotten and become a mere footnote in her life . A pang of regret stabbed him . It was better not to think .   A faint humming caught his attention . It could be another insect but his heart rate quickened slightly . It was a relief to find an excuse to have hope , if only for a short time .
`` Hey , I got the stuff . ''   `` All of it . When do you want to meet ? ''   `` No , no , I can be there . ''   `` Just make sure no one knows where you are , okay ? ''   `` This is all gon na work out , I promise . ''   `` Trust me . We 'll keep it secret . ''   `` I 'll see you then . ''   BOTH SIDES   `` Hey , I got the stuff . ''   `` Flowers and all ? ''   `` All of it . When do you want to meet ? ''   I do n't know . She gets home early from work . During lunch break ? No , I 'm sure that wo n't work for you .   `` No , no , I can be there . ''   You 're the best . I 've been waiting so long to do this .   `` Just make sure no one knows where you are , okay ? ''   Sometimes she visits me at lunch . I 'll figure something out . Maybe I 'll just propose right then and there .   `` This is all gon na work out , I promise . ''   I love her so much , so this needs to be special . I do n't think she 'd expect this from me unless someone told her .   `` Trust me . We 'll keep it secret . ''   Alright . Lunch break tomorrow , then ?   `` I 'll see you then . ''  
Frank and Timmy were friends for as far back as Frank could remember . As boys , they would do pretty much everything together . Frank was the wild one , Timmy more cautious and thoughtful . When Frank 's parents fought , which was too often , Timmy would sneak in a window and spend the night . They 'd read comics by flashlight under the covers to help drown the yelling . The day Frank 's parents split Timmy took him to the park and assured him it was n't his fault . The swings at the park is where they spent many bad days to come . When Frank wanted to kill himself Timmy talked him out of it .   Frank aged and matured , but Timmy kept his boyhood innocence . Despite the maturity gap , Timmy could always calm Frank and they still spent time in the park . They both loved licorice and would usually share a bag while skipping rocks or talking on the swings . When Frank finally outgrew the swings , he 'd still push Timmy who fit just fine . Just after Frank 's twenty second birthday , he started taking some medication . Timmy came around less and less . Even though Timmy is gone , Frank still finds peace in the park and sometimes still pushes the swing .
`` I do n't know how you can stay up for so long . '' my flatmate said as he stood up , shuffling towards his room . I stayed slumped on the couch , fiddling with the Xbox controller . More Netflix .   `` G'night mate . '' he mumbled as he disappeared into his room . I heard snores not too long after . I jumped up and closed the door to his room but the noise had already gotten to me .   I need a cold shower . The water left me shivering and I felt relief . I did n't feel sleepy . Back to Netflix .   I smelt a damp musty scent .   My brain was falling asleep . Shit .   I scrambled up and rushed to the kitchen , jamming the button of our dilapidated coffee machine . The coffee machine 's noise barely registered but I started hearing loud whispers around me . As a last ditch attempt , I slapped myself . My ears rang .   The coffee machine gurgled and clicked . I poured myself a huge mug , scalding my hands slightly . I squeezed my eyes shut and swallowed a mouthful of hot coffee .   The couch beckoned . I rested my head on the base . The last thing I felt was the coffee mug slipping from my hands .   * '' Your Highness , please wake up . We need to run , quickly . The rebels have discovered King Henry . `` *
I gasped with wide eyes as an array of beautiful fireworks exploded over the lake . The Fourth of July was easily my favorite holiday , mostly because it meant my whole family would be together at our cabin on the upper peninsula of Michigan . This year everything was going perfect : the fireworks were beautiful , my parents were getting along , and on top of that the mosquitoes were n't half as bad as they usually were this time of the year .   But then everything changed when an extra big firework exploded in the sky and turned into a dragon . The dragon burst into life from the colorful ashes of the explosion and instantly began torching the woods that surrounded the lake . I grabbed my baby sister and ran for our cabin , intending to head down to the basement before getting stopped in my tracks by an extremely curious phenomenon : something was coming out of the ground ! All around me drills were popping out of the ground and then going back into the earth , only to have hands pop up moments later that appeared to be trying to reach the surface . Could this really be happening ? Zombies and Dragons on the same day ? No , the chances of that occurring were slim to none , there had to be another explanation .   That 's when the first of them emerged above ground : a full grown , 5 foot tall china man holding an assault rifle . All around me , China-men were popping up like daisies . The bastards had did it , they had really fucken done it ! Tunneled through the Earth and caught us off guard on our own independence day .  
The Trojans stood at the gate , wondering what to do with the lovely offering presented by the Greeks . As they were about to bring it inside the city , a strange man suddenly appeared out of nowhere in a flash .   `` STOP ! '' he yelled . `` THE HORSE IS A TRAP ! ''   `` Who is this man ? '' the Trojans began to murmur . `` He must be a god ! '' they concluded . With this conclusion , the Trojan general opened the rear compartment of the horse and outpoured the Greek soldiers , killing the general . This was not a wise move , since they were severely outnumbered and then slaughtered .   `` The general is dead ! '' yelled a Trojan soldier . `` All hail the new general ! '' he pointed to the man who had appeared , but as strangely as he had appeared , he had now disappeared , as strangely as he had come .   When the time traveller arrived back in the future , he noticed many statues that looked exactly like him . To his horror , he realised he was living in the land of Troy .
Susan sprang out of bed and tilted her head in the darkness . The jingling and faint clip-clopping filtering down from the roof could only mean one thing . She dashed upstairs and barged through the door at the end of the hall .   `` Mama , Santa is here ! ''   She sprung onto the bed and jumped up and down a few times , barely missing landing on Mama 's figure several times .   `` Mama , Santa ! Mama , Santa ! '' She chanted as she bounced on the bed .   A muted *whump* from outside pulled Susan out of her boucing fit . It sounded like something very large fell into a snowbank outside . After that , the world went silent . She stepped off the bed and crept to the window , holding her breath as she went . Carefully lifting the edge of the blinds , she peered out into the night .   There was no Santa lying in the snowbank . To Susan 's surprise , there was n't even a snowbank . The lawn was green under the ambient glow of the streetlamps . Susan scanned the street and her surprise turned to horror when she spotted the truck idling in the shadows .   *whump*   White mist filtered into the room through the open door . Susan dropped the window blinds and scuttled backwards across the floor to the bed . As the men in the SWAT vests started pouring in through every door and window , Susan picked up Mama 's cold hand , careful not to tear what little tissue-thin flesh remained over the withered limb .   `` Mama ? I do n't think it 's even Christmas yet . ''
The house had stood the test of time . The tide of change ebbed and flowed outside its walls , but inside nothing ever changed . Through the front door , boots stood unlaced and muddied with laces tracing the same pattern as 100 years before . The coat rack held a vest , a hat , and an olive drab uniform coat still adorned with the mud of a day 's training . Inside the kitchen , a saucer sat with an ornamented cup holding the leaning spoon of a long dried tea . At the rear of the house , the bedroom was warmed by the morning sun shining through opened curtains reminding the floors of the summers of youth . The covers of the bed were pulled back and a book sat by the pillow with a page forever bookmarked at page 162 . It 's master had gone to war .   When the soldier left , they could n't bear to change a thing . When the soldier fought , they would walk through the rooms praying for his safety . When the soldier fell , they came to the house and remembered him . The small cottage became the last monument of the young soldier , and a lasting tribute to a fallen son .  
I find myself .   Turns out I was there all along .   Inside myself , in that roiling realm of rigorous rites , that 's where I 've always been . That 's where the 'me ' who is really me stays . And I think it 's because he likes it there . Things do n't make sense , but they do n't make sense out here either .   At least he gets a good view .   He gets to be there in that world of wonder and I 'm out here in this world of drudgery and death . This world that hangs me from the timelines of promised futures , each one tight around my wrists and knees , pulling me along , whispering sweet lies in my ears .   I understand why he did it though . I would too if I could swap him places . Make him the shell , let me be the soul . Let me be the comfortable one in the depths of my heart , let him spend his time dealing with the world .   I thought I was lost . In reality I know exactly where I am . I just wish I were somewhere else .
You shouldn ’ t of applied for the job . You needed work , and “ nuclear technician ” sounded like it paid well . Greg said it was a sure thing ( his uncle owned the power plant ) and although you had only made coffee up to this point of your career , you were hopeful this was a “ learn it on the go ” position .     Then the meltdown started happened , and coincidentally the primary reactor cooler was up for maintenance . You pulled the emergency levers , sweatily called all the appropriate government agencies . Now you were running down a hallway rushing to find all the staff who could offer you more information about how to -- shit .     You pull off your Vive , and look it over , before throwing it over your shoulder just to silently float into the zero G. The battery could barely hold a charge , it probably lost your save . Outside the window of the International Space Station , the planet is barren , save for a narrow band near the equator you could see shrink from green to brown and yellow day by day . Soon you will be void of all water . You check the instrumentation , the water distillery had about 3 weeks left before the filters clog from your urine . This would outlast the food stores . Looking down at inhabitable red sphere your planet had become , you wonder if anyone will ever discover that there was life on mars .
*Just handle your shit . Keep breathing ... *   Who was he following ? The predator/lizard ? He 'd never seen anything like this , not on any cosplay , comicon , bdsm , or anything this side of Hollywood . Everywhere he looked since they had come into this space ... was this the Tunnel ? It was way bigger than that place had been , and he was reasonably sure he was not in Manhattan . The acid was really strong , he would definitely not need the other tab . He steeled himself against the panic . This was fucking incredible wherever he was , and it was after all , his element.. .   It seemed like everyone was checking him out even though his must be *the least* impressive costume out of everyone here . The fog machines stank to hell but it more or less fit the bill .   *This is like a performance group or something , this is some shit right here . Everyone is definitely looking at me . *   He looked again for his host , but he could n't even say what he had looked like . They had both stood out flamboyantly at the party before , but now , he just knew that these folks put on the real dill right here .   Again the flash of fear . Plus a fully fleshed out hallucination of this actually being not a costume party at all . He repeated his mantra .   *Just handle your shit . Keep breathing ... *   Everyone was definitely looking at him .
*Report that again . That made no sense . You are saying we can just do whatever ? No matter what the harm ? *   That is correct Overlord .   *But they are known for their rules , I thought this would be our most challenging yet ! *   Yes Overlord , you are correct . That was the case . Normally we could not just pump our toxins into their air and water .   *But why is now different ? *   I do n't understand Overlord , but they have a new ruler who said rules did not apply to us . We just have to appear in front of a camera with him and proclaim that he is the greatest and we will move our Xylong 128-A plant to his landmass and enslave numerous of the citizens in the factory .   It does n't even matter that we were going to enslave them anyways once enough succumbed to our nerve agents . He just wanted credit and then we can do whatever , bypassing all laws .   *It 's hard to believe , but good job Commander . I 'll alert the fleet*   Um , one more thing Overlord- he insists on a video of him grasping your pincher in his . It 's some odd ritual where he will attempt to pull it off , but be not alarmed , he is old , feeble and dimwitted- no match for you .
`` Hey , Mom , how 's it going ? ''   `` What do you mean ? ''   `` No , wait , just - just slow down Mom , you 're crying , I can't- ''   `` ... what kind of accident , I do n't ...

The human lie detector . That 's what they call me . I 've always skirted around what I do in interviews as frankly I did n't understand . Micro-expressions , nervous tics , word usage . These are the things I used to distract . I never realized the truth , not until my 100th case at the precinct . Number one crime solver , internationally recognized , Time magazine 's man of the year . I helped put away rapists , murders , serial killers . Sometimes there was no evidence , I would ask leading questions like if the body was in a forest . From there the truth would be apparent from their lies . Sometimes we did n't find the evidence , but that was alright . They always confessed . I thought that being able to tell when people were lying was my ability , my place in the world . But I want you to think this through . If someone can tell if your lying , how do you not incriminate yourself ? Do n't talk . Everyone knew about me yet they could n't resist talking to me . And that 's when I realized I had put away countless innocent people . I was the liar , but everyone could n't help but believe me .
I 'm not going to write the verdict , just an entry from a field observer . It is , after all , just a prompt . This could be terrible because I 'm on my phone .   Day 41 , 21.3.5.674 , or August 28th , 2014 , year of our lord   I like them . That much I can say for sure now . They warned me about becoming attached to them when I was deployed here , what with their similar anatomy ; but I just ca n't help it ! They 're a mostly harmless group of individuals , although they are no where near ready for contact . In small groups , they are an excellent bunch of fellows , they love , care , give , have fun and do all that other warm fuzzy stuff . On a multicultural basis however , they a bit retarded ; although they are making progress . They have strong and juste spirituality , but it is far too often perverted as an excuse for war . Humanity seems to have an undying lust for power . When they lose this greed , and treat their foreigners as they do their neighbors , they will be ready .
The world burned . We , the arsonists , were tired of starting the fires that strangled us with smoke . War after war brought us only death . So we choose to change . To evolve . After all , we were the ones who brought misery upon ourselves . We fought each other , we killed each other , and for what ? We already knew the answer .   Peace would always come , lasting a few years , centuries if we were lucky . But our nature would always send us back at each other 's throats , thirsting for blood and vengeance . A never ending cycle .   So we chose to end it all . A racial genocide of sorts .   We were not fools though . Our struggle would end but another 's would begin . If our race could be birthed into existence then so could another . So we chose a different option .   We killed our mortal bodies .   We exchanged our flesh for metal and uploaded our consciousnesses to a virtual database , a hive mind of sorts . We chose to give up our emotions there , to rid ourselves of the cause of our conflicts . In doing so we undid the work of countless lifetimes , ending our existence as we knew it in mere moments .   You are not the first race that has made it to this point and you will not be the last . We must not let cycle repeat .   We will give you the same choice as we did the others .   Join us , or be destroyed .   **END TRANSMISSION**
`` Google has stopped everything ! With their damn wireless and then Zuckerberg sweeps in and puts planes in the sky to block us out over entire continents ! Bastards ! '' Mariah shouted at her three sisters sitting on the small rock in the middle of a cave .   `` Well , it ca n't be purposeful . The internet is quite a success , '' the third youngest said , she wore a blue gown and had her hair done up with chopsticks .   `` Wifi is n't . It prevents us , how dare it do that . These men must all work wit the NSA , the national Sorcery Advisory , just to watch us and stop us . Well , I 've had enough , it 's time- Edwarda ? Do your worst to them ! '' Mariah shouted .   Edwarda was the eldest sister to Mariah . She 'd spent years embedded in the NSA , and now had collected enough data on their information tactics and the stop gates used for blocking magic from influencing the modern human , and now she 'd tell the world . Of course , she could n't be so direct . She came up with a lie about the internet being unsafe , hoping at least enough humans would question it that they 'd stop preventing so much magic in the world . The gamble had n't worked in the slightest , hence the cave , now it was time for something much worse Edwarda had cooked up- an EMP .

I discovered my ultimate when I was a kid . That was rather embarrassing , and I was lucky that I got away before they figured out who was responsible . But now I understood my power , and I vowed that I would use it appropriately .   At the moment of the 20th anniversary , I did not see an immediate opportunity . I 'd figured out the general idea , but the obvious target - the revolution in Turkey - ended the day before . So I waited . I obsessively tracked civil strife throughout the world , waiting for the right moment . No one would see this coming .   Two years and nine months later , it happened , this time in Mauretania . Mass protests . Police crackdowns . No military involvement . Perfect . I boarded the next flight for Nouakchott . And as I stood in the street , between the protesters and the police sent to beat them into submission , I closed my eyes . Most of my life , I had been waiting for this moment .   I raised my hand , pointed it at the police , and cried out `` AND THEN THE WINGED HUSSARS ARRIVED ! ''   Eight thousand medieval Polish cavalry came boiling out of nowhere , the wings on their backs producing a deafening noise . Their lances and sabres made short work of the cops . In four hours , the Winged Hussars controlled the city , and I controlled the Winged Hussars . I handed off power to the protesters , and boarded the next flight home .
*29 April 1945   I believe that the world will never understand my nature . The Chinese speak of yin-yang and yet does not truly understand the concept . Opposite forces act complimentary to each other and yet my actions are met with damnation and seen as villainy . Perhaps I am villain . Perhaps I was born the part . But there are two natural actions in this world : that of giving and that of taking . Only the Lord , both Alpha and Omega , was giver and taker . The plant provides fruit , and the man harvests . And what of the lion , whom upon dominance of the former leader , also destroys his progeny . Is he met by a court of lions ? No . He reigns supreme . But therein lies the problem—human nature and mother nature contradict . Where mother nature commends the fittest , human nature condemns . One finch on Island Galapagos kills the other in an act of supremacy and for lineage . Am I not the greater Finch acting out the rules of nature ? I am . Nature creates creatures that were designed with a specific goal . I am the Omega . *
Recognition .   It was stark recognition staring back at me from shock-widened eyes . Eyes shot red with sleepy melancholy . Eyes bagged with solemn solitude .   Eyes mirroring my own recognition .   Of this man I knew so well , yet not at all .   My limerent obsession .   My imagined bedfellow .   Fretful nights of disturbed sleep - not waking , yet never truly resting - we worked together , side by side . Diligently . In silence .   We toiled to rip up the dusty floorboards of a cold , failed world . We planted trees , and ideas . We threw our need and love for this fresh new creation to each edge of the hazy horizon and brought vitality to our precious little garden .   Each morning , the dream all but faded as the grey smog of existence curled back over me .   Each morning I awoke unrested , and filled with a bitter-sweet longing for this man in my dream .   Each morning , his face was all that remained . His steadfast , determined expression . His unspoken love and encouragement .   And now he was here . More solid and real than anything is ever known .   He took a step towards me .

A single tear drops on the page . I squeeze the letter I never thought I 'd get . I shoved it in the interior pocket and pressed on to the lab . I was already late you see as my mother does n't make sure my alarm goes off or if I 've even set it .   I 'm 45 minutes behind everyone else , and Oak makes me stay behind and watch his recorded orientation . I 'm finally done watching and come out to find that jerk Gary about to choose his pokemon .   Predictable . I 'm a few minutes late and Gary gets the last pokemon . Oh well , off to Hogwarts I go . Except , Professor Oak had one all along . A feisty little yellow ball of spark . Sparky ? No , no nicknames .   Little did Oak know , I was planning to escape this militant lifestyle . I would take the train to wizarding school and now I 'd have my pikachu too !   I 'd be the only one there with a special electric friend . I 'd come come to catch them all during my breaks from school . Did I ever need those breaks from school . Destroying all evil and dealing with the prejudice wizards was almost too much to bare .   Now , I 'm in the best position I could 've ever imagined . I 'm on a journey with a few short creatures so similar to humans , and wizard whose powers rivaled Dumbledore 's , and I 've had the best wizard education and a pack of pocket monsters to boot ! That piece of jewelry does n't stand a chance !
The outlook was n't brilliant for the Frizzlesnaps that day ;   The score stood Quark to pizza , with but one inning more to play ,   And then when Hobbes died at first , and Susie did the same ,   A sickly silence fell upon the patrons of the game .     Then from 5,000 throats and more there rose a lusty yell ;   It rumbled through the valley , it rattled in the dell ;   It knocked upon the mountain and recoiled upon the flat ,   For Calvin , mighty Calvin , was advancing to the splat .     There was ease in Calvin 's manner as he stepped into his base ;   The western wind snatched swiftly at the tatters of his cape .   And when , responding to the cheers , he lightly doffed his crown ,   Then stood upon his head and threw up on the ground .     Ten thousand eyes were on him as he rubbed his hands with juice ;   Five thousand tongues yelled `` SQUIZBAT ! '' as he juggled seven fruit   And now the chocolate-covered sphere came hurtling through the air ,   And Calvin stood a-watching it in haughty grandeur there .     The pitcher-king was dancing in the customary way   He signaled that the Quarkball was about to enter play   The umpire rolled a dice to see which way the ball would Splat   When Calvin , mighty Calvin , laid him low with several *thwacks* .     And now the quarkball spirals up , guided by a kingly throw .   And now the air is shattered by the force of Calvin 's blow .   He has not hit the Quarkball ; merely cracked his tender head   but by the rules of Calvinball , he is victor , nonetheless .
NEWS FLASH : Today in a surprising turn of events , recent internet celebrity Daniel Lara has committed a string of crimes in the past few hours .   It all started this morning when Daniel assaulted a pedestrian upon them uttering his famous internet catchphrase `` DAMNNNNN DANIEL '' which we believe caused Mr. Lara to snap and beging violently attacking the individual .   From there Daniel proceeded to hold up the surrounding convience stores with a firearm hidden inside his shoes . His technique consisting of him self waiting for the cashier to say `` DAMNNNNN DANIEL '' in which he would respond by pulling the gun out of his shoes to say `` BACK AT IT AGAIN WITH THE WHITE VANS '' .   After robbing several stores in this manner , police arrived at the scene and when Daniel refused to cooperate with the officers they were forced to arrest him . He is currently being held until trial . Here with us today is the police chief whose unit was responsible for arresting Daniel . `` Officer , do you think this behavior is excusable ? Is it possible that Daniel will be released anytime soon ?   `` Well madam currently we do not know what to do with the young man . I personally believe he is a danger to society now and needs to remain locked up . When we were making the arrest one of our officers was assaulted by that damn   Daniel . I believe I speak for everyone when I say if he were to be let out he would go back at it again with the white vans . ''
It was the eve of November 4th , 2008 . As he looked in the mirror , he took a deep breath . He was not looking forward to tomorrow because , regardless of what happened , he was getting some bad news . He adjusted his earmuffs ; they were filled with a sizeable amount of ice , like most celebrities ' were . This is the curse to being famous , he thought , you have to deal with the consequences . In a way , he sort of hoped that he would just lose , just so that he would n't have to suffer the infamous burning . While he had had to deal with this pain for a good portion of his adult life , he knew that whatever had come before would pale in comparison to the immense scorching sensation that he would feel tomorrow . Next to no one else would ever be forced to deal with the level of constant pain that he would endure , but , he thought , the others before him had succeeded , so why ca n't he ? Even if it hurt , he knew how great it would sound to hear the words `` President Obama '' . That is , if he could hear at all .
She rubbed her legs together , enjoying the feeling of her freshly shaved legs and crisp bed sheets . It was a warm night and her damp , newly dyed , red curls felt nice against her neck and upper back as she turned on her side and reached for a pillow to hug while she slept .   If anyone saw her in the sports bra and capri styled yoga tights they would think she was a fan of athletic activities but a second glance would show a lack of any muscular definition on her body . Her small frame which was normally drowned in a baggy blouse was on full display . Her thin waist a perfect ratio to her moderately sized breasts . She had heard people call her pretty before but she often looked in the mirror and thought `` average '' or `` childish '' . The one feature that she did pride herself on , was often overlooked by others . Her hazel eyes , a mixture of light brown and olive green the only feature she had inherited from her grandmother .   Her plump lips were slightly parted as she turned away from the pillow she had been spooning while somehow managing to keep it pressed against her back , as if it were someone laying beside her . Soft snores could be heard coming from the small , young woman as she dreamed about being productive and finding romance .
They hate my human but love my mask , I am the human condition magnified .   There is n't much left of who I am now , nothing left for me anyway . When I was a naïve youth I swore to dedicate my psyche to achieve true selflessness ; Twenty years later of walking that road I have lost my center , I have lost my silence .   I will save the world from Octavious and Decepticons , but I will also revoke the mannerisms of the masses . From a birds eye everything looks different , and when lost in the desert I 'd rather have a mirage of an oasis than eternal sand dunes . In the end no too much compels me truly , my heart beats freely and my path is stone . I often wish that stagnant happenings would again snowball into manic hysteria as it did in the days when I was still sane , but alas we all must grow up .   We must either grow into something that has a place in this world or die . We all want to die young and be remembered as a hero , but I fear the truth of the matter is those of us who live trapped behind blue eyes are the true favorites of the cosmos . Maybe Jesus was a cowered ; I would be nailed to a tree if heaven was waiting for me .   Anyway , the ramblings of a public servant such as myself fall upon deaf ears it seems , and so I shall silence my bitter soul and continue to play this roll .
I gazed deeply into the album . Inside was the man who had put this silvery bond upon my hand . Perhaps I could ask Her .   Every week she came to visit . Thursday at 6:00 every time , she arrived with her scrapbook . We would sit and look through the album and she would question me . It has been a month now and the best I can do still is to shake my head .   `` Why is this ring on my hand ? '' I inquired .   `` No one knows ... '' She let out a sigh , `` Do you still not remember what I have shown you ? '' she asked .   `` I do know now , but I suppose that is learning , not recalling . ''   `` Well I best be going now . '' She got up to leave but I called out , `` Wait . I have one more question . ''   `` Yes ? ''   `` Who made this ring ? It 's a perfect fit . Was it someone close to me ? ''   `` You would n't know would you ? If only you could remember , '' her eyes welling with tears , `` It was you Dad . ''
`` That 's why I have an extended mag , doc . '' Mr. Fox fired every round , with about 3 out of the 20 rounds actually hitting his target . Fox laughed as he stuck the gun back into his trench coat . He 'd taken to calling people `` doc '' , as a bit of a joke . It was his thing , like how Jack Nicholson always shouted , `` Here 's Jonny ! '' when he was taking out targets .   The Actor 's Guild was a bit more than just a way to make sure Hollywood 's elite got top pay . Actors were the ultimate assassins . With the right amount of makeup and costume design , they could blend in . Be anyone they needed to . Even the beautiful ones , like Brad Pitt could become someone totally different , and totally *nail* his role ... and also his victim to a wall , belly sliced open and entrails dangling like wind chimes .   Michael J Fox was the best . It was why he did n't have very many roles in recent years . His Parkinson 's was a perfect cover . And it made his assassinations look like street-level crime . No professional would need to fire 20 rounds just to kill one guy . The scratched off series numbers on his guns added to the effect . Looked like illegally obtained weapons were used for the murders . So , Fox always got his guy into a dark alleyway . Always had his extended mags . *Always* got his man .
It 's been two months since I got back from war . Part of my left arm is gone and I can barely speak .   These are dark times for me and my family , but I take solace in the fact that I will soon be compensated and recognized for my valiant efforts in battle . I wake up one morning , and the President of the United States is by my bed . My painkillers make it difficult to hear , but I can make out the gist of what he says .   `` I personally would like to award this honor for courage in armed combat . '' He says .   A camera flashes , and a *human heart* on a gold chain is placed around my neck . It is still throbbing and bleeding , but I am unable to move .   `` Ladies , gentlemen , and the press , I give thanks to Jim Smith for his service and hereby officially decorate him with the **The Heart** medal for military merit .   My sheets are soaked in somebody else 's blood . I manage a smile and the camera flashes again .   [ In case it is n't clear what I 'm getting at ] ( http : //en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Purple_Heart )

John Constantine woke , and sat up in the bed . Rubbing his face , he saw an electronic clock sitting on the bed near his feet . Words flashed across the screen , followed by numbers . John looked at the clock , considering . He grabbed a pack of cigarettes off the nightstand beside him , lit up .   `` 'Time until death ' ? 7 years , 43 days , 50 hours , and 26 minutes ? '' He rolled his eyes as he took his first drag of the day .   Lazily , he reached over and picked up the clock . A small red button on the back . Unlabeled . John grunted . Pushed the button . He turned the clock back over .   The numbers had changed , the words hadnot .   `` Four days ? Really ? *For that ? * '' He looked up at the ceiling , pondering . Such an arbitrary change , obviously the button itself had no effect on his lifespan . He was being fucked with .   Constantine was used to being fucked with . He could deal with being fucked with . And only one being could claim to control his lifespan in such an arbitrary manner . He swung his legs over the edge of his bed , stubbed out his cigarette . He got dressed .   He put on his trenchcoat , grabbed his keys and clock , and walked out the door . As he left the lobby of his building , he tossed the clock to a homeless man on the curb . The man caught it , looked up at him , confused . Constantine kept walking .   *God . What an asshole . *      
She was not the only one to suspect the truth . Gods had come after humans , and though they were neigh omnipotent , they were not ones that create life and death . She was one such who rebelled , helping to direct souls to the land beyond the horizon , rather than the underworld , the domain of the gods .   Hades and Persephone , the gods directly affected by this upstart witches ' impertinence , petitioned the other gods in punishing this upstart . As she had not technically violated divine law , they were not allowed to kill her . However , they could make her live a lonely life- around her was cast an invisible nest of thorns ; any suitor that she grew to love would wither and die away , and any women around her would grow jealous of her beauty and ostracize her .   Unperturbed , she set about building a lifelong companion . Gods lacked the capacity to create souls , instead needing to power their works with the prayers of worshippers and those souls they had claimed as this own . Humans and creatures below heaven could create souls , but only through their offspring . She wanted to create something altogether new , to infuse a golem with a true soul , creating an individual identity , one that could be her partner , her equal rather than a servant to her ...   End of part 1
`` So , visit here often ? '' The lad approached the cute girl he saw at the corner of the bar staring at the wall . She did not twitch an eye , nor did she move her head to see him .   `` My name is Johnny . '' He offered a handshake , trying not to lose his smile . The girl finally looked at his direction with her dark blue eyes . She looked down at his hand , touching it awkwardly before finally shaking it .   `` May I ? '' He pulled the stool beside her and sat down . She kept staring at Johnny with deep concern .   `` You do n't talk much , do you . At least , beauty talks for herself . '' A little giggles were heard at the other corner of the bar . Johnny turned to see him friends whispering to each other , then laughing maniacally . He gestured a 'silent ! ' and resumed his conversation .   `` What 's your name ? ''   `` ... ''   `` Work ? ''   `` ... ''   `` Hobbies ? ''   `` ... ''   `` Oh for heavens you *do not* talk at all ! '' Johnny 's voice was surprisingly angry , despite his innocent looks .   The girl kept staring , this time her mouth wide open and her eyes peeled . He grabbed Johnny 's hand and opened it , and with her index finger traced her name on his palm .   *Abigail . Please , do n't leave . *  
She would 've been 37 today . I picked up the pen in the morning and realised I ca n't imagine her at 37 . I ca n't see her any differently than how she was the last time I saw her in the morning of the day she died .   Every time I try to imagine crow feet in the corner of her eyes or white strands in her hair the image fades until a stranger stands in her place , a woman I do n't know , a woman I 'll never know .   Today was a bad day . Her mother stopped talking to me five years ago when I refused to stop posting her images . Let her die , she said . Now there 's no one to talk to on her birthday . I watched one stupid movie after another until the TV turned to static .   It was close to midnight by then . I feel we have a connection , on her birthday . The minutes were ticking down and I was so scared I was about to lose her .   I ca n't draw you anymore my darling .   I do n't want to forget how you look . Already started to forget the sound of your laughter .   The bottle of pills and the wine are right here . First , let me put on that waltz you always liked . We 'll need something to dance on .   -- -   -220
Simon did n't like to use his powers . When he put on his crown he turned into a different person . He coud hardly control himself when all of his suppressed hatred and anger for the world was suddenly all he could think about . When Simon put on his crown that gave him his curse and blessing he became nearly unstoppable in ways more than one . The way he became scared not just him but the one person who he cared for more than himself . Marceline could n't even recognize Simon once he put on his crown . He despised the crown with everything he had , utilizing it only to save Marceline . Simon refused to accept that who he became was actually inside of him . He tried to tell himself that its just the crown and he would n't need it anymore and he could be done being ashamed of how he was with it . But somewhere , something went wrong when he lost all he cared for . He put it on one time and just left it on top of his head . He would n't have to be disgusted if he never turned back . So he stopped taking it off and soon he simply forgot . He forgot who he really was . He forgot about Marceline . And he turned ice cold .     I 'm just thinking about Adventure Time

Ever since I can remember I had a gift . A gift of knowing how `` dangerous '' a person might be . I measure people on a scale of 1 -10 , people in comas are a 1 while dictators and supreme leaders hit a 10 .   I 've never seen anyone hit a ten in my life until I turned on the t.v . and saw a democratic candidate running for president again . The chills I got when I saw him smile , those chill that haunt you and stay with you . The candidate was a very charismatic guy and a ladies man too . If only they knew how dangerous that man was ...   Months passed and he won the election . I could n't believe it ... With that power now one know what will happen . Will he be the cause of a new world war ? We are already in a bringe to war with Russia ! Damn it ! This can not be happening ! I have do something but how and when ? I live in Dallas and he 's in Washington D.C. , I 'll have to kill him when he 's here . But I just ca n't remember his name ...   I just ca n't remember his name , his name started with a J , J what ? J ... J ... Got it ! John ! John something Kennedy ! That 's his name ! J.F.K . On the 22nd he will be here . I got to get my things ready ...   If I do n't stop him ...   Who will ...

`` Why would you say that ? ''   `` Why now , after all this time ? After everything that we have been through ? Have I not proved myself to you ? Have I not done enough ? ''   `` A 'compulsive liar ' . Why would you pose such a statement ? What could you possibly gain from painting me in such an insidious way ? How do you profit from such a position ! ? ''   `` What you propose is false . And you know it , but there is nothing I can say now , is there ? You have quite efficiently and effectively rendered all my retorts , all of my counter arguments moot . ''   `` Your accusation is an attack on my character , while ensuring that I am ensnared within it . Unable to move or defend myself with words . You strike at me with your claims , while I am impotent to counter your exclamation . For if I do , there is nothing I can say that will exonerate me , by the simple nature of your assault on my character . How do you have any idea that I 'm not lying ? ''   `` A very clever ploy . ''   `` So be it , if I can not use my words as my defence , I shall employ my actions to speak for me . For actions can not lie . Whatever comes of this , I want you to be of full understanding that you have forced my hand . ''
  ★★★★★ **The Most Truthful Book I 've Ever Read**   When I got an advance copy of by T. N. Errans , I thought to myself , `` Who mailed me a book cover ? '' I 'll admit , I did n't understand at first , but after repeated readings , I got it . This book , with nothing in it , is the most profound and truthful thing I 've ever read . It 's the only book that 's objectively true ! Some people might find that vacuous , but for me it was an eye opener . Would read again ! In fact , I just did !   ★★★★☆ **A book without cliches ! **   If you 're tired of authors pulling out the old Deus Ex Machina , then is the book for you . There 's none of that . No plot holes , either . No loose ends . No cringeworthy dialogue . I 'd say there 's nothing to hate but personally I 'd like to have seen more character development . Or , for that matter , characters .   ★☆☆☆☆ ** ? ? ? **   Where 's the fucking pages ? ? ?
Freedom . That was the first feeling that had rushed through Rachelle as she drove away from her home of five years , belongings stuffed into the truck . Freedom from the man she had believed to be her soul mate . The one who had tricked her into believing he was the one for her , all because he had shared her blooming rose tattoo . Curse him for taking advantage of her easily-viewed mark on her arm ! Rachelle could n't believe that his actual mark had been the sword on his stomach , rather than the matching rose on his arm he had procured after seeing her own .   After the initial bliss of finding her soulmate , the relationship began to go downhill . But Rachelle had held on , knowing that it had to get better ; the tattoo proved it ! Five years of hope . A different hope from that which characterized the first 20 years of her life , awaiting her soul mate .   Even as he cheated , drank , and gambled , she held onto that hope . A hope that weighed on her , pulling her down and away from her friends and family .   And then the discovery . A careless sentence spoken in a drunken stupor , and suddenly , the weight was gone . She was free . Free from the chains she had placed on herself . Rachelle knew , from then on , she would never rely on the tattoo . Never again would she place the reins of her life in anyone 's hands but her own .   Rachelle continued driving , an armband covering up the rose .  
Erika stared at the phone . There were no clocks in the room , but she knew the time . She found it surprising , the way her mind worked right at this moment . She seemed to be taking in every little unimportant detail . Her breathing was steadier then she expected , she was n't upset , or scared , not even sad .   She reached out her hand , and rested it on the receiver . She counted her breathes . Three ... Two ... One ...   brRRcct- `` Sarah ? ''   `` Damn it Erika . Do n't do that . '' her voice was strung tight , like her vocal cords were rubbed raw . Or perhaps about to snap .   `` Was it.. ? '' That was all Erika was able to utter . No tears , no pain , but something *something* deep down began to fray apart .   `` Yes . '' Her voice hitched . Erika ' heart did the same . `` Exactly as they said it would . ''   The color drained from Erika 's face .   Even if they knew precisely , they deserved far better a death .   `` So what do we do ? '' Erika 's hands began to shake . Her black hair clung to her tears on her face . Pain and suffering , mixed with desperation .   For the first time in her life , nobody in her family knew what happened next .
# # # People 's Daily   *Party Journalist in E China Commits Suicide*   ( [ Xinhua ] ( http : //www.xinhuanet.com/english2010/ ) ) 12:29 , August 2 , 2015   An editor for the official paper in China 's Shandong province hanged himself Friday afternoon . The journalist in question was a member of the press agency Xinhua , which recently undertook a campaign to investigate writers of fraudulent stories , briberies , and other forms of corruption in the agency .   Zhou Haijun , 32 , had served as an assistant editor at Xinhua for three years , and as a writer for eleven . The police ruled out foul play in the preliminary findings .   In June , Zhou was reprimanded and demoted for a sensationalist , unfounded article regarding backdoor meetings . The article accused senior party members of colluding and spreading insider trading information on the freeze of stock trades that eventually took place in July . The accusations were found to be baseless in internal investigations . His co-editor for the piece , Zhang Xingli , has recanted the article and apologized for his indiscretion , stating definitively that neither man had inside knowledge .   ( Editor : Zhang Xingli )
*Do n't turn around . *   This is what you tell yourself . Every night , you repeat this command . You do n't ask yourself why ; you just do . Because you know it 's there . Something hidden in the darkness . No : hiding . It chooses not to reveal itself . It wants you to believe that it exists , but you dare not prove it so .   *Do n't turn around . *   You can feel it . Tingles spread across your skin every night , because you *know* it 's there . Lurking in the shadows , just out of sight . You want to look . You want to turn around . You want to shine a light into the dark , to satisfy the nearly insatiable urge to see exactly what it is .   *Do n't turn around ! *   It 's right there , at your back . You feel its breath on your neck , hot and sticky yet cold as death . Chills scamper up and down your back , and you struggle to remain calm . Your heart is pounding , you can feel the sweat on your forehead . It 's close - too close !   *DO N'T TURN AROUND ! *   Your head snaps to look behind you . Nothing . Just the darkness .   But you know it 's still there . Hiding .   Is that laughter ?   *Do n't turn around . *
After living through epidemics , natural disasters and merciless wars , we 've become a dull blade , I feel we 've been walking through a jungle with no end . Restrictions and limitation set upon our previous bodies lifted , we 've become something less , no we 've become more than simple beings whose only goal was to survive . Despite our self proclaimed immortality we never achieve or reach out to our now estranged world . We 've lost our purpose , no reason to struggle and fight . Material wealth has accumulated to a point where we do not need to lift a finger for ourselves and it has left us docile . We 're no better than animals left to rest in it 's cage .   it was the struggle and fight that put a light in our eyes , we dull in convenience and frail in comfort . So i ask you to hand over the key and let me walk away . I wish to travel the world once more , i 'd rather be burned than buried , my ashes to urns have them carried . Let us return to our remains we 've left this world a long time ago . Will you leave with me ?
all of the cities killed off by rt 66 would still be thriving . The government would n't run itself into massive debt building the interstate system . the roads that are in existence are ran more efficiently by private investors utilizing low cost tolls , most likely in cooperation or by the auto manufacturers to install a `` go pass '' or `` toll pass '' in each car to read the mileage and charge the appropriate amount . Companies create and handle roads around their business to spread the costs as much as possible . The people have a lower tax rate because there is no longer a 50 year life expectancy on roads . so the burgeoning infrastructure cost is not present . Most likely there would be a different mix of cars because without the emphasis on the American dream in a Cadillac with the family going cross country there would n't be a mass subsidy of internal combustion engines to promote car ownership . This means that other fuels would be utilized as the market demands fluctuate with the supply of oil , see the oil crisis of 1970s . without the massive production of roads by government the idea to subsidized cars would not have followed . without this mass subsidization of cars and the adventure of cross country travel ( road tripping ) , inner cities have better developed mass transit . pollution would be reduced in major cities and due to lower car ownership rate .
It 's strange , you know ? I thought that reaching the end would actually be the end of it all . I thought it would be the last time I traveled to a foreign place and dealt with danger . I thought that death would be far from me . I thought that I would have more options presented to me .   But , instead , I 'm presented with two options . Do I live to tell my tales ? Do I become the famous adventurer that I had dreamt of since I was just a boy , or do give it all up in hopes that death will bring me truth ?   It 's a hard choice to make . If I live , I 'm granted with another day to seek the truth for myself . But , if I choose death , I could just be given the truth without any worry of ever having to find it . I truly did hope this was my last adventure . I did .   The more I think about it , the more it becomes abundantly clear what I need to choose . What good is the truth , if you ca n't share it with everyone ?   I thought this would be my last adventure . I thought wrong .
The more I searched , the more she seemed to surface . It was beginning to feel unnerving . Was this all a coincidence ?   *Was I not alone ? * The door suddenly opened .   `` Anything the matter , sir ? '' My assistant asked , peering over at my work . I grabbed my research .   `` Nothing at all , '' I replied , stashing the last of the papers in my drawer , `` nothing at all . ''   What had she seen ?   She stared at me . Something in her expression worried me . `` For someone considered to be the best historian in the world , I 'm surprised it 's taken you so long , to be honest . Why do you think I chose you ? ''   I stared at her in disbelief . What was she admitting to ?   `` 17,000 , in case you 're wondering . 17,000 years . ''   `` ... What ? ''   `` I 've been alive for 17,000 years , give or take a millennia . It 's been quite a wild ride , '' she said , smiling .   I did n't know what to say . This was all so unbelievable . Could it really be ?   `` Why tell me this ? Why join me in my research , if you knew you 'd be discovered ? ''   She stared at me , and laughed .   `` Because , Mr Historian , I 'm pretty sure I last saw you at the fall of Rome . ''
You realize this because she tells you . People immediately bust in the room telling everyone to `` get down . '' You look at her with panick in your eyes . Not like this , you think . The image of the white person in The Matrix before her plug is pulled flashes through your mind . What would Neo do ? you think . That 's when you see her dying in five minutes , unless you can do something , preferably now .   A minute forty five seconds left and you 're still not down yet . You 're staring a barrel down with quiet fury . Hell , you think , I guess I ca n't get shot in the head . You immediately grab the gun , pulling it to your head , testing fate .   She looks at you with panick in her eyes . `` Do n't do this , '' she says .   A minute thirty seconds left , now everyone is staring at you , wondering where this is going to go . It appears someone wants to die . One of the people looks at another saying , `` you have four minutes . '' That person screams and lunges for the gun pointed at your head .
This was great . I had finally mastered 360° vision . There was still a ton of freaky sex stuff I had n't done yet , and 360° vision was going to make it at least that much cooler .   I teleported to one of my many dream mansions and flew into a window on the upper level . I approached a large golden door . On it was a platinum plaque with words I could n't read , but I knew what they said `` Oiled Writhing Virgins Room '' . I could hear moans and giggles beyond it . `` Maybe Mohammad was right about the after life . '' I thought with a grin . This was going to be awesome .   I slowly opened the door . The room was dark , and the moans were louder . `` Come here hunky boy '' came an enchanting voice . I could already feel delicate hands grabbing my legs and crotch . My clothes disappeared . I could n't wait to see these honeys in 360° vision . I reached over to the light switch and flipped it . Nothing . I flipped it a few more times nothing . I was getting frantic and soft . No matter what I did , the light level would n't change .   `` That 's not fair . '' I yelled , `` That 's not fair at all . There were virgins now . There were all the virgins I wanted ... ! That 's not fair ! '' I bursts into tears .
I love everyone . I like it when people are with me , and they seem to like me back . The only problem is that when people are with me for too long , they get cancer . Let me start from the beginning .   Ever since I was born I was a loner . No-one hung out with me , I would just move around doing nothing . Eventually , after a reaallllyyy long time I managed to get a few friends , they were n't much but whatever . This circle of friends slowly got bigger , we would pretty much hang out all the time and not a moment would go by when I did n't have a friend around .   Not all my friends get along with each other , sometimes fights start and I try to break them up but I ca n't really do much . Before long I must have gotten pretty popular because my friend group grew *exponentially* and I was always with people and I loved all of them .   Back to the cancer . I always had an effect on my friends , I give them gifts that they show each other and everyone 's happy . I always give out as much stuff as people want , some people use it for their homes and some use it on themselves . Some people get greedy though , and take too much . This gives them cancer .   I try to help everyone , but you ca n't do much when you 're a giant ball of flaming gas .
So then God says to me , `` My child . You 've been struggling . '' I look down in shame . I manage to squeak , `` Yes sir . '' I can feel Him staring at me . Not in anger , not in annoyance , not in disappointment , but He looks at me in love . But of course , He is perfect . I 'm the one who fucked up .   I 'm the one who let others get to me . I 'm the one who danced with the devil . I 'm the one who should have asked for help . But God understands . He knows everything . And yet He loves me anyway . I try to look up , but there is a weight holding my head down .   `` No child , do n't look . Just listen . Do n't worry . You are here for a purpose . I have a plan . Trust in me . Have faith in yourself . I am always here for you . I love you . And I want you home , in due time . ''   I meekly respond , `` But why not now ? What am I supposed to be doing ? Why am I still here ? '' I hear a quiet laugh .   `` Instead of always wondering what is is you should be doing , you should just do . ''   I muster up the strength to look up . I see a light off in the distance . I let out a sigh and go on my way .
I stood up . `` I guess this is it , huh ? '' I looked over to my wife , just as beautiful as the day I met her . I thought back to 50 years before . I had proposed to her on this spot in the woods , but that was a different time ... A time where birds still sang and the wind still blew . I remembered that in began to rain on our walk back to the car . What I would do to feel the rain again . My wife did n't say anything . Her eyes were closed .   `` Honey ? ''   Her eyes opened , `` I love you John . '' I laid on the barren ground beside her , and took hold of her hand .   `` Forever and ever babe . '' I heard her breathing stop , and I knew the only living sound on the planet was that of my muffled sobs into her shoulder . I was all that was left . I rose to my feet , and began walking to the cliff where I had sat with my wife so many times before . When I arrived , I closed my eyes , spread my arms , and fell into the dying ocean .
Dust becomes mass ; becomes light ; becomes life .   Life becomes death ; becomes beauty ; becomes dust .   A cycle perpetuated through all time and all space , from first light to everlasting darkness . Until only dust remains , scattered unto the edges of an entropic universe . And when there is nothing left to die and decay , all beauty will be gone .   Only survived by faint echoes .   Echoes of the first great cosmic symphony . Each star , a faint note in the movement of movement itself . All things vibrating ; resonating like a string plucked by the hand of God .   But all strings eventually snap . All songs come to an end . Every echo fades .   Stars , clamoring in crescendo , trading mass for light ; life for beauty . Dust returns to dust .   And as each brief note adds to the chimeric celestial chord , all we can do is rattle . Our embers will never glow as brightly . Our songs will never be as melodic . Our deaths will never be as beautiful .   Our mass ; our light ; our lives ...   Our dust is not our own .
`` Of course , today marks another anniversary of me taking on the name of my late predecessor . Thank you all for being here . I will repeat my story once again , especially for those who are newer here . I mean you Alex , yes I am looking at you . ''   The speaker smiles and points to a face in the crowd . He pretends to act nervous and hides himself . This creates uproarious laughter from the crowd . The speaker continues .   `` I would post things simply to get a reaction out of people for as long as I could remember . All the circle-jerking and people posting popular statements simply reinforced my desire . Bernie Sanders would make a great president , building the wall that Trump proposed was the best decision ever made , and praise for China as being the foremost nation of activists towards human rights ; these were the popular comments that everyone tended to make . All these clowns were just posting replies on up-voted comments in order to get their name out there . I finally died of old age in the year 2043 . The man upstairs asked if it was all worth it . I told Him that it was the only way I could function wholeheartedly with peace of mind ... ''     The speaker goes on to elaborate on his most hated controversial statements . Laughs and cheers are plentiful in the audience . His speech finally finishes .       `` I just wanted to thank all of the massive supporters who agree that I have done better in the office formerly held by Satan . Thank you all for coming . I could n't do it without you . ''
Hi younger me ,   Remember the guy that pressured you again and again and again ? You made the right choice by not giving in . You made the right choice by refusing to take him back . He got his next girlfriend pregnant . That might have been you . Someone else will be able to love you , I promise ; there 's no need to swear off men . Hang on tight for a few more months because the next guy that asks you out ... is the one you will marry . Do n't try to image what he will be like because you 'll be wrong . He 's better than you can image , especially because he is real . He is going to work hard for you every day and love you more than you can understand right now .   You know how you did n't have everything figured out ? Well , you still do n't . But , you 're happy . Really really happy , and you 're making a difference in your community . Plus , you have direction now . You 've found out what you are passionate about and you 're pursuing it recklessly . I am not going to tell you what your `` passion '' is , you 'll have to figure that out for yourself . Be patient , the best it yet to come .   From me   Edit : missed a word , and I ca n't handle not fixing it
`` You 're not a god . Gods do n't bleed . ''   `` Well they do n't fuck their sisters either , but I mean how else are you going to make Ares , Hebe , and Hephaestus ? '' The young man retorted . He regretted his choice of words when he narrowly escaped a lightning bolt that would 've struck him in the family jewels .   `` Insolent child . Do you not know who you 're talking to ? ''   `` The One-True Siscon ? Fuck you and your lightning bolts , Zeus . And your shitty ass opinion too , you do n't determine who a god is . '' The young man said , flipping him the bird .   `` I can end your life in a mere instance , yet you remain . Why are you so stubborn ? ''   `` Because you 're being a big ass bitch . Try me . '' The young man offered , putting his hands behind his back . In a fit of rage , Zeus began to hurl lightning at the boy . When the dust cleared , he still stood there , unharmed but even more pissed off .   `` And see , that 's what I mean . I do n't want daddy issues or anything , but you pretended to be a woman , seduced my mom , and then made her a constellation . I should beat the fucking brakes off you . '' The man said , beginning his descent down Mount Olympus .   `` ... Arcas ? Wait ! ''   `` Fuck . You . I might only be a demigod , but that still does n't mean you can do fuckall , shitty old man . ''
Born , defective .   After a childhood spent watching the space shuttle I realize , “ I want to be an astronaut. “   Loving parents reply , “ Of course you can ” ( if it were n't for your heart )   “ Astronauts need good grades ” , and I get them . AP , Honors , Dual Enrollment . But it doesn ’ t really matter . My leaky heart aches .   So what shall I do ? I love making art , “ but that ’ s no way to support a family ” .   I worry about career so much , I can ’ t hold down a hobby . A year of karate . A year spent rowing . A year in the band . A year of competitive mountain biking . Now I am an artist who doesn ’ t draw , a musician who doesn ’ t play , an athlete who doesn ’ t train .   I 'm good with computers , maybe that 's what I 'll do .   Uninspired , I change majors . Change majors . Change majors .   When scholarship money runs out , I graduate . Industrial Engineering is where the wheel stops .   I need a change . Seattle . The excitement of change fades quickly when I grow disillusioned with the work . Is it the job , or is it me ?   I ’ ve spent my entire life trying to figure out what I should do with it . Now , any answer seems preferable to none .   This is can ’ t be the conclusion .  
Some hailed the first successful animal reanimation as `` the culmination of mankind 's collective labor . '' Others simply called it necromancy . The debate between scientists and philosophers bled into the public domain and engulfed society in such a polarizing chaos that human trials were delayed by nearly two decades . Almost twenty years of supporters and activists and terrorists all claiming they had the right answer ( and often fighting to prove so ) . But it only took a few moments for the technicians to induce consciousness when they brought me back- no longer than it would take to wake me up on any other day ... just as if someone had pulled the covers off .   I can still see the changing looks in their eyes . Hopeful and curious and scared ; then complete horror as my body began to move . But I was just as much a witness to the terror as anyone . My consciousness had returned , but its vessel was no longer mine . The body began scanning the room , person-to-person , like a starving mad butcher- every few seconds erupting into a fit of crazed laughter , driving many onlookers to hide their faces . I wanted to hide too . I wanted to run and latch on to another soul like mine . I wanted to shout , `` Oh God ! Oh God ! We 're not alone ! We 're not even in control ! '' But , how do spirits communicate ? No , I waited until the body discovered me inside and mounted my mind and preyed on its warmth .
`` One of us has to go in there ? '' said the Satanist .   `` Has ... to ? '' Asked St. Peter confusedly , while below on Earth a jet full of terrified people slammed into the ocean in part of god 's confounding master plan .   The atheist and satanist locked eyes and cried `` Not it ! '' in unison before racing past Saint Peter 's post and the gates of heaven to the stairway that led to hell . Saint Peter watched their forms disappear down the long flight into obscurity below , and shrugged .   He tried not to think about it , and tried not to let it bother him , but there was work to do as the capacity of a 747 began lining up for processing .   The light at his booth turned from red to green , indicating there was room again in heaven , and he processed the load of new souls as per usual . He did n't know why heaven was full sometimes and sometimes not , but that was something else he tried not to think about .   It was n't like god was in there eating the souls or anything , right ? He 'd never really been inside to check , and it *was* awful quiet , but he tried not to think about it .   From the stairway to hell the sounds of music , drunken shenanigans , fornicating and fighting drifted up , as they always did . It almost sounded like fun , but he tried not to think about that .
Today is the day . Somebody is gon na take me off the self , bring me home , and I am going to entertain them for ... at least a good seven years . And that is fine with me .   Lights are turning on ... here we go ! Bright and shinny smiles . He comes the kids .   Hey ... .hey kid ... .oh ... ... G.I . Joe is a good pick too . Here ... here I am ... ready for your enjoyment ... .oh ... ..well ... .batman is a really cool toy . With all those awesome attachments . Ok here we go ... he 's looking at me ... .he 's picking me up .   `` Mommy I want this one ! ''   `` Kevin we 're shopping for your sister . Put it back . ''   He dropped me on the floor ... .maybe they are just going to get the money to pay for me ... ..the employees are closing up the doors ... .sure hope he gets back soon ... .they 're turning off the lights ... .all the cars are gone ... .it 's ok , I 'll be right here where he left me when they get back tomorrow ... ..   Yeah ... .tomorrow
The warmth of her lips comforted my soul . At that moment , as she kissed me tenderly , I just knew she would forever be the love of my life . However , I had the strangest premonition , almost as if I was looking into her soul , into her future , as if the gentle kiss had granted me clairvoyance . In my minds eye I witnessed a struggling drug addict inflicting pain on herself and all those around her , spiraling to the darkest depths of the human world . A total disregard of life and a lack of love for those who only cared for her . I softly pushed her away and expressed , `` I do n't think I will be able to handle it . '' I rose to my feet and walked off into the distance not once looking back .   A short few years had come and gone , and then word of her passing made it 's way to my ear . As I sat at her service and listened to her family share their memories , I thought about how I knew this would happen . I knew it would happen , and I did nothing to prevent it . I did nothing to help . Perhaps I was the cause of her death . Perhaps I was the cause of her addiction .
It 'd have to be a time before the dawn of civilization when humanity is too weak and underpopulated to prevent me from conquering them with modern weapons and technology . Once I 've conquered every living person in that time , I 'll establish myself as emperor of the world or I 'll form a global republic idk .   People in the Stone Age had about the same intellectual capacity as people now . Still , new skills and knowledge are n't learned overnight . It would take numerous generations for everyone to understand how to use the technology I 've brought back with me , to fully integrate into the pan-global culture I helped form , and all the speak the same language .   I 'd have the opportunity to prevent climate change by forbidding the use of fossil fuels or at least so much of it . Encouraging the use of non-polluting energy resources .   I 'd also have to leave behind a message for my descendants so that the world never forgets why I changed history in the first place . Humanity would be more advanced because of me and still have thousands of years to catch up and become a match for the aliens .
No one thought I could do it .   `` Crazy , '' the papers said , `` A pipe dream . ''   `` This guy 's just gon na crash in burn out there ! His goose is cooked ! '' said the young blonde on daytime television .   What did I care ? I had billions of dollars , millions more coming in every day . And the cancer was spreading through my body .   So I built the thing , from the ground up . I got right into it when it was finished . And then I was off .   No one thought I could do it . But I did it . I 'm here . And now I can see that it was the worst mistake I 've ever made .   They said I would never make it this far . And I wish they were right .   You see , a few minutes ago , I woke up from my cryosleep groggy from the long ride through space and the extended lack of consciousness , an effect of the technology that had kept me alive . As the thousand-year sleep left my eyes , I found myself surrounded by clear walls . A cage . Outside , strange beings peered in , gesturing at me , buzzing amongst themselves with an alien form of conversation .   And I do n't think they 're trying to cure my cancer .
The capacitors whirred down , and the clamshell contraption noiselessly cracked open its mouth . The boiled air puffed through the widening seams in the sealant rings and rolled through the stagnant space between , washing over me in a sterile cascade . The compartment was empty ; all that remained of her was the heat that tickled my skin into goosebumps .   She had been the last woman . I could have created a child with her , created a new generation together . She had been hope for the greatest of species . She had left me eagerly .   I am the endling .   The Ascender beckoned me with an indistinct chime . This machine would have no further purpose after it consumes me , none left for whom to chime . A clamshell as simply a discarded shell amidst a planet of skyscraper and highway carcasses that four years ago were the high-watermark of civilization .   The comet had cracked . Scientists had n't expected it , and the shrapnel would obliterate our insubstantial solar system . We had to get out fast , faster than human bodies could manage .   Two hundred and eighty-six thousand starships had already cast off with eighteen billion uploaded consciousnesses . They would be deployed in Mechas after safe arrival in the next habitable solar system , nearly thirty light years away . A new intergalactic species , self-evolved beyond the limitations of genetics . The final ship waited for my code .   No . My species would not suicide in a puff of heat .
When I first met Bernie , I was taken aback by his mannerisms . He continuously licked his lips in an offputting manner and stared wide-eyed around him . He seemed to grin randomly and at things I could not find humor in .   He began to tell me his scheme to get rich quick .   `` Da eleets , ya see ... '' he went on in his strong East Coast drawl `` need ta pay . Dose fatcats have got all da money and if you stick with me kid , we 're gon na take a bunch of it back ! ''   `` For the American People . '' I said quickly   He grinned and glared up at me , looking perplexed . He licked his lips , like a lizard . `` Yeah , yeah sure . The American People . Right . ''   We spoke further about how he was going to use the Government to steal money from people who had more than he did , and that all of Bernie 's friends would be in government to spend that money . He asked if I wanted a job in his Cabinet once he ruled the Free world .   As he began to lick his lips even more I began to realize the truth . Bernie Sanders was the [ god damn Loch Ness Monster ] ( http : //img.ifcdn.com/images/aa531e9761a937a905c8dbe572e91d245b1b6a861459d829b0872446c93c7e48_1.jpg ) ...
`` Hm this is an odd list , would n't you say Spence ? '' Mark spoke to his roommate .   `` Yea , it 's really odd . Who are these people ? '' Spencer questioned . `` I mean a few of the names are really . Like Dwayne Carter - Lean Overdose , but then the fact that I do n't seen the names of anyone I know . ''   `` Hm , odd . Maybe it 's a hoax . Lil Wayne quit drinking Lean like a year ago ''   `` Or so he he says ''   `` Indeed . In fact one way of knowing exactly if the list is a prophecy or not , is for us to go and **kill little wayne** ''   `` Agreed . Let us go to America , and **Kill Little Wayne** ''   `` In the morning though , I ca n't function without my tea , and starbucks wo n't open for another six hours . ''   `` You mean to say you do n't have any ? ''   `` I 'm terribbly sorry but I drink it so much I usually run out within the week . ''   `` What a shame . ''    
AH , another fantastic day of absolutely nothing ! I 've been here for as long as I care to remember , time does n't hold much sway with me as I never age , which is just fantastic is n't it ? ! The average day consists of me watching the sunrise with my buddies , they do n't say much and neither do I , we 're all men of few woods and even less action I suppose you could say ! After that , I 'll check up on my human friends who live under me ( they still use internet explorer ) , but they never say anything more than some gibberish that I ca n't understand . Oh well ! Anyway , what was I talking about ... . OH YEAH ! I was telling you all about the move ! They way I got here was rather odd , I was sitting around doing my normal rock things , when suddenly ; two guys ( that 's you ) with big shiny things came running down the hill ! You started to bang the shiny things together , and said some mean things to each other ( you guys were probably just playing ! ) . Eventually , you got tired and dropped the shiny thing , then your buddy decided to introduce me to you , and here I am , in this dark squishy place . The other guys left a while ago , but I guess you 'll stick around ! I have so much to tell you new friend ! Where to start ! We have so much time together !
`` Humans are completely uninteresting and ordinary , '' Zandyr of the Galactic Anthropological Society concluded . A collective sigh arose in the room . Impersonation of them at the Educational Theatrical Competition would then be easy . Months of research , observation and selective probing had lead to the mission report and now they could begin to plan and rehearse their performance .   The chosen actor tirelessly practised the performance . Getting the gestures and the atmosphere down to perfection . The costumes took even longer and had to be sent back several times after a misprint in the design brief changed 'ordinary , uninteresting ' to 'extraordinary , interesting ' .   And now months later they performed their act in front of a crowd and a panel of judges .   **A Day in the Life of an Earthly Human . **   *The costumed actor awoke in his bed , he rose yawning and used the toilet ( amused laughter from the crowd ) . He ate his toast while staring at a square box with images . Then brushing his teeth and showering ( whispers and pointing from the crowd ) . He dressed in a suit and drove to a tall building . *   Zandyr watched from the balcony above . Carefully observing the crowds reactions , his sensitive ears following their laughs and whispers . The play ended with the actor asleep once more . The curtains closed , the crowd applauded politely , and whispered to each other . It had gone well he thought , satisfied by the performance and the hard work gone into it .   At the end of the night the judges results came in . They had scored second , with first place going to the Galactic Cuisine Society .
`` Hey Alex ... why do n't you ... why do n't you come over here for a lil ' bit . Just a bit . ''   I 'm sitting at my desk as the sultry voice continued to speak . I have n't got a lick of work done ever since this whole thing started . I do n't even know how it happened .   `` C'mon . Just take a sec . Just ... y'know , grab me a little . Put your hand on me . ''   I called the police and they told me to stop making prank calls . Would n't really blame them .   `` Do n't you like looking at me ? My curves ... my body ? ''   `` Please , I do n't have time for this . I have a paper to write . ''   She remained persistent . `` I need you Alex . You..you complete me . We complete each other . You know you want to . I want you to feel my neck ... ''   Maybe I am going insane . I look over to my left and see her there . Just propped on the couch , in the lovely sunburst finished .   `` Fine . FINE . If I play with you a little , will you let me work ? '' I shouted .   `` Sure honey . Just get over here and feel ... ''   I rolled my eyes , got off my chair , and plugged in my Statocaster , letting loose a heavily distorted chord with a quick strum .   Heh . That does feel good .      
I 'm tired of people not taking me seriously . You think the worst thing about being a child is being weak or fragile ? No ! It 's people ignoring you . I 've been alive for 4 hundred years , ever since I 've tricked a daemon into stopping my aging process , and even then , when I was only 10 , I was smarter than most of the adults ! Imagine what it 's like now , when I know more than most of the living humans , to be treated like a child every time I meet a stranger .   And now again .   `` Hey , Teddy , why do n't you go play with your toys ? '' - I 'm grateful to these people for adopting me , of course I need to keep my appearances and what can be better for pretending to be a kid than this ? In a few years , before they can realize that I do n't age , I will run away or disappear . But until then , I have to put up with this . `` Teddy , you have to eat soup before you can take candy . '' - come on , woman , I 'm a grown man , I am older than you , I *want* my candy !
'Well , ' the man said . 'That was a lovely chat , but I think I 'll be off now . '   'Hold it right there , ' said Bob . 'Do n't leave yet . Have they told you who I am ? '   The man cocked his head .   'I am the son of Oberyn Martell , and do you know why I 've come all the way to this stinking , shitpile of a city ? '   The man grabbed his knife , but Bob grabbed his first .   'For you . '   Bob slashed the knife , slicing off his earlobe .   'I 'm going to hear you confess before you die . Oberyn Martell . You gauged his eyes out . You smashed his teeth in . You blew up his head . '   Bob kicked him in the nuts . The man fell to his knees .   'Say it now and make this quick ! Oberyn Martell ! You gauged his eyes out . You smashed his teeth in . You blew up his head . '   Bob grabbed the man 's throat . 'Say it ! Oberyn Martell ! You gauged his eyes out ! You smashed his teeth in ! You blew up his head ! '   The man tore himself loose from Bobs grip and threw his weight onto him . He clawed his big hands around his skull .   'Oberyn Martell ! ' , he shouted . 'I smashed his teeth in , then I gauged his eyes out ! AND THEN I BLEW UP HIS HEAD , LIKE THIS ! '   Bob felt a sickening pop .
`` It was insane man ! ''   `` what , what happened ? ''   I had been in my bunker , with my family praying to every god imaginable after the government announced the meteorite heading for earth .   `` But then , duuuuude , this tidal wave rose up out of the earth ! ''   `` wait , what ? ''   `` And then , and then , zombies started man , like , everyone who was dead was n't dead anymore man ! ''   `` Oh my god that 's terrible ''   `` but it gets worse ! Hell broke loose and demons came out , they wanted to start killing people too ! ''   `` Jesus Christ , you ca n't be serious ? ''   `` But man , you do n't even know , the tidal wave took out the meteorite and then zombie hitler and satan 's armies just started fighting and they sides lost everyone ! ''   `` ... .What ? ''   `` yea man , nobody died ! Can you believe it ? ''   `` No i cant fucking believe it , what the hell ? ''   `` everything worked out man , nobody died ! ''   `` You 've got to be kidding me ''   I sat down , among the rubble of what used to be my home   Unfucking believable .
They sat in a circle at Zombies Anonymous , pasty faces all , waiting their turn to speak   `` I mean I *remember* distinctly when it happened ... I was 14 , inquisitive and full of life ... I was reading a book - *Dorian Grey* - and I thought to myself ... what would happen if I just sort of unfocused and *deliberately spaced out* . I felt guilty for even thinking to do that . I *knew* it was evil . But I thought it was harmless so maybe I could give it a go and see what choosing an evil action would be *like* . So I did . I just ... stopped ... *focusing* . I sort of turned off my conscious awareness . And from that moment on ... ''   The man swallowed a rising gulp of anguish , but continued in a voice that threatened to crack .   `` ... it was like I had betrayed myself . I was n't proud anymore , I could n't look at myself ... so I stayed that way . On autopilot . For *twenty years* '' .   A sob escaped . He continued , spluttering ;   `` I stopped judging ... I stopped caring ... I married a girl I did n't love ... and went through the motions ... I gave up on my dreams and life was grey and not real to me . Like when you drive and suddenly find yourself arrived , and ca n't for hell remember your journey ... ''   His pasty head morphed sadly into * '' The Scream '' * as the horror of his crime sunk in .   And he slumped off the chair , slamming his skull into paste on the cold tile floor .
Numbers taste funny . Nines bud into fires on my tongue , their spent embers resembling something akin to zeros . Ones bleed blue like melting ice or my nurse 's cerulean eyes . Fives dissolve like Wonderbread and feel like cotton in my ears . When I went to school with other children , they tasted like loaves of stale white bread . Always purple fours at their desks , bland twos yellowing during educational videos . Peppery sixes on the monkey bars , but I would only watch .   My favorite numbers glowed orange , tasted like hot tea . One time , I tried to make the school turn red . Billowing pillars of smoky eccentricity , almost making nines . Eights running down the crimson hall . Sevens helping fallen sixes . No number tasted blue . And then they started putting me in another classroom . The seats ' kaleidoscopic occupants percolating and icing throughout the day , especially during music time .   Six weeks later , the alarm bell exploded fantastic . The door became a prism of sixes bumping into sevens , bursting into nines , knocking over eights . I was not supposed to leave the room . Five minutes the screaming Wonderbread burned the cotton from my ears . My tongue rolled electrically and someone finally heard me .   A boy wandered in , soot-faced and smiling . White-hot teeth burning from his mouth . Eyes like zeros . Nostrils flaring like volcanoes .   `` Another ten , '' he said , and strolled away .
I know this is bad , i did n't actually have time to do 500 , i gave it a shot , it 's currently 191 , and kinda bad , but i wrote it and i figured someone i would n't let it go to waste , someone might want to read it . And yes i was watching psych while writing ...   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -   With the invention of the Hasdon microscope we have discovered that there is a material smaller than an atom which actually creates the atoms we know today . Scientists are calling these Burtons . We were limited to only a few Burtons arranged differently depending on what it needed to be . We found something interesting about Burtons , they actually think and react to be what they need to be .   Years after this discovery a man named Shawn Spencer accidentally found a radiowave which had the ability to control these Burtons , He could make them become anything he wanted by just inserting a code similar to the way modern times QR codes worked . Put simple with this radio signal he could create any material in the world from any material in the world .   And this is when the world has begun it 's own destruction . Religious fanatics used this tool against scientists because they thought we were playing god . They used the signal to chemically change all science books to only be written with gods will , in hopes people will forget about this signal and the world could go back to normal . It never will .
Alright , here for some CC .   Your descriptions and imagery are really good , and your vocabulary is impeccable . Keep it up .   Your main flaw is rhythm and I honestly ca n't tell what 's happening in the story .   > I stared in solace at her figure as I followed , while she looked back at me with a peek . Her subtle existence coursed through the insensible breeze that separated empathy with intimidation . Her oceanic-expansion of consciousness , drowning me in a provocative peace at the act of interaction . A peace that did not silence chaos but embraced it with the purpose to forge a chorus in thought . We stood anterior to a restaurant ’ s entrance she ’ s been longing to try .   You 're trying too hard . The story feels forced and stiff and lagging . Try to show , not tell .   > I stared at her petite body as she strode ahead of me , then stole a quick peek behind to see if I had followed . Her hair and figure in the summer wind , the chaotic peace I somehow felt with her , the way I wanted to drown in all of her whenever we talked .   It may or may not be your intention ( I could not tell , which is a dangerous sign ) , but the revamped one is two lines shorter and less literal .   All in all , keep the vocabulary , but do n't try to spread it all over your story . Great words do not mean great stories , and simplicity is something beautiful on its own . Good writers are made , not born .
It would be easy to lie . To say I was in the front lines or I fought code to code in safe houses .   The truth is uglier . I worked at a bed and breakfast in the Highlands . I did n't know much about computers - I still do n't . I could work the Office Suite pretty well , navigate the 'net , but nothing more complex . I only knew that HTML told the webpage what colour to be .   At the start the isolated areas where holdouts just because we did n't know what was going on . When all you have is dial-up and the mobiles are n't reliable you expect to miss things now and then . Not the End of Days , as we did , but ...   So I did then what I do now . Run the flock up the west side and keep the cattle in order . Breed collies as needed .   That 's how I met your ma . She was a hotshot dog shower . Now she has as many dogs as she wants .   Oh , and watch the cliffs to see if any nicks try and climb out of the deep . They have simple programming . Often times they like to go for the toes . And you 'll do the same .   After you lean how to walk .
`` This your first time ? '' he asks me , moving foward to shake my hands . He smiles widely , exhaling a puff of seam . Flecks of snow lie thick on his ginger beard . He does n't seem to mind .     `` Does it show ? `` I laugh , shivering .     `` Do n't worry . We all have to start sometimes . You 'll love it up on the mountain . ''     He gives me a thumbs up .     `` You sure you want to go up there , today , though ? Weathers rough . ''     I shake my head yes , `` Kinda have to mate . Personal quest of mine . ''     He nods understandingly .     `` Yeah , I understand that . ''     He moves to go away , turning towards the blonde on his left he had been talking to earlier , and they begin to trudge away .     `` ... and then I had to cut the line . Jenny and Kevin ... . ''     `` You killed my parents . '' The words burst of me .     But they die in the cold , lost amid the wind ; they 're too far away .     And then I see him turn around .     `` Say what , buddy ? ''
I opened the door to the apartment . The windows were boarded up . Slivers of light cut through . I walked to the fridge as I had been instructed . I opened the door and took a peek-   `` Achoo ! '' burst a voice from the shadows .   I flinched with fright .   `` Bless me . '' said the hooded stranger . `` I have the Alice Potion you came for . ''   I could n't see his face but it mattered little what he looked like . Markus needed me .   He handed me a small vile with white liquid . If I did n't consume what I assumed to be poison my best friend would be killed . The hooded bastard with outstretched hand had called me earlier that day and let Markus speak briefly . His life was in my hands and I owed him mine .   I took the vile . Popped the lid . Sniffed it and downed it in one . It was ... salty . I slammed it on the table bathing it in a slice of light . The captor of my friend started to giggle slightly . My gaze was drawn to the silver tea pot that reflected the vile . The vile itself was labeled 'Muk : Ekans Arbok ' but the mirror image on the tea-pot ... there was something in it ... the letters were all screwed up but if you took that into account ... it read ...   `` Markus ! You fucking asshole ! '' I shouted and swung for him .
`` I have n't been planetside in ages , '' John shouted over the roar of re-entry .   `` This is the third time this year I 've stood on real dirt . '' Brian lifted his head , finally waking up . Our ship was little larger than a capsule , big enough for just the three of us . They told us the heat shield was tough , but for some reason I could n't shake the feeling the millimeter-thick ceramics were going to fail . We rocked around in the air like a skipping stone .   `` How 's our descent looking ? '' I asked , failing to take my mind off the heat shields .   `` One hundred kilometers and dropping , we should hit the clouds soon . '' John brought up visual . Flames licked the camera , translating to streaks of bright colors on screen . After a few minutes , the flames died a bit , revealing the dead planet .   `` What kind of god ... '' Have you ever seen your home after a big fire ? How the wreckage still smolders for days ? Each one of us felt something deep down , some recognition of our ancestral home . We were n't ready to see the truth first hand .   That the world was still burning .
They do n't usually answer back to what i say . That is actually not true . They never answer me . There are days when i ask my self why i even bother saying anything . I have this delusion that one of them must answer me . These mannequins cant talk though . If they can then they taunt me .   They stand there and stare at me . They taunt me with their silence . They 're ignoring me . I know they can hear me . Why would they continue to stare at me if they could n't ?   I yelled at her today . We were sitting at the dinner table . I dressed her in her favorite dress . A pink blouse with a flowery pattern on it . She looked stunning . The perfect imagery of beauty . I asked her to perform a simple task . Pass the salt . It was so simple . Yet she ignored me . she just sat there . So I yelled and I yelled and I yelled . I yelled for hours at her . I yelled so long that my voice hurt . Now it hurts to say anything . I am trapped within my self now .   I 've decided to stop saying anything . My voice hurts to much anyway . What is the difference between me and them . I can no longer talk . I 've lost everything yet I do n't feel bad . I finally fit in . All i can do now is get in line with them and stare .
`` What is it with you people ? You keep saying that i am wrong , that i am convoluted , but let me ask you this . When Abe Lincoln , yes the tall hat wearing guy himself , say that niggers are not to be seen only as slaves but also as human beings , was n't he going against the norm ? When ... When ... People , disgusting people , yes , but still people nonetheless , people like you and me , normal people who fuck with animals , yes , you heard me right , fucking with dogs ... dogs and cats and horses and whatnots , you claim that it is a travesty of desire . the fuck is that . But when i know , when i know for a fact , yessir , that living is a fucking pain in the ass , why is wrong for me to gun down people so that they can meet god ? What 's wrong with that ? hell , you guys should give me a fucking medal for releasing them souls so they can meet nirvana.Fuck me . And mark my words , you sons of bitches , twenty years down the road , you will know , i am the new right . ''
It 's all my fault .   You 've probably said this at some point in your life . You probably meant it , too . It 's almost certainly not true , unless you 're me . Because if you are , then yes , you 're right .   Because it 's all my fault . Because you 're dying , because of me .   I killed you . No gates or guards can protect against what I made . My first child , my worst child . This horrible thing , this *horrible* thing . I engineered it .   If it makes even the slightest difference , I did it for knowledge . For us , for all of humanity . Trespassing in God 's domain . Was it really wrong ? How could I know it was wrong , until I did it ? Why would it be *there* , unless we were meant to know , to unlock the secrets of life ?   But you are coughing , and retching , and dying , and asking you rhetorical questions will give me no answers . You would n't believe me , anyway . I can see the twinkling of my child in your eyes , and of course you do n't believe me .   I do n't know why I do n't die .   I think it might be punishment . I blink , and another generation passes , and the answer still escapes me ...   ... Why did I eat that apple ?
“ There ’ s the treadmill ” The scientist said , pointing out the giant , unmissable conveyor belt beyond the glass wall to all his new interns . “ And behind the treadmill is the pit ” the scientist pointed to the distant half of the room . “ We fill the pit with alligators and place the test subjects on the treadmill , and every hour we make the treadmill move a little faster . The experiment doesn ’ t stop until every subject has fallen into the alligator pit ” .   “ That ’ s horrible , professor , what in god ’ s name is this supposed to prove ? ”   “ That people don ’ t like treadmills ” The scientist replied . He paused for a second before adding “ or perhaps it proves people don ’ t like alligators . Who knows , we ’ re still trying to work out another experiment to find the point of this one ” . All of the new interns jotted down the scientist ’ s response , to serve as a note-to-self about never volunteering for any treadmill or alligator related things in the future .  
Whilst wandering down a deserted road , so eerily quiet you can hear the gravel moving with the wind , I spot a small leather-bound object . As I approach it , I notice that it is what they call a 'book ' . I have seen many of these at the larger camps , but never one this far out . I was one of the few who were taught to read at a young age , and found much more enjoyment reading about fierce battles between the undead and us .   As I flicked through the book , I noticed that many of the pages depicted events that happened before The Incident : large-scale famines , buildings collapsing and wars . As I read into it a bit more , I find out that the life that once was , is actually worse than what we have now : Sure , we have to be alert for the undead , but everyone is cautious of other survivors . We all look after one another , watch each others backs , and give hope to those who need it .   I hear the monotone moan of a horde of them , accompanied by the shuffling of feet on the gravel . I pick up the book and place it in my bag , replacing it with a medium-sized rifle . One day this will all be over .
`` I 'm pregnant . '' This was the woman he was supposed to marry . Her words only reassured him .   He imagined a baby girl with her brown hair . A curled lock dangling in front of thin eyebrows . A toothless smile .   `` You 're happy ? '' Sarah said .   Michael nodded . `` We should get married , '' he said .   She ignored him . `` How could you let this happen ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` This was n't supposed to happen , '' her voice groaned on the last word . Her rounded nose flattened towards her lip . She narrowed her eyes at him . She hated him .   `` Is n't this ? Are n't you ? '' His eyes darted around the room searching for understanding . A bookshelf . The bedroom door of her childhood bedroom . The closed laptop on her desk . He could feel the early wrinkles in his face creasing . `` Happy ? Good ? ''   Water formed behind her eyes . `` You 're not , '' she coughed suddenly , her voice exploding out of her chest and barely making it through her lips , `` the father . ''
`` Sure I do . '' Jamie said . She scratched idly at her chin . `` But what 's the point of dwelling on it , you know ? ''   `` Sure . '' Chris said , taking a gulp of his beer . `` Sure . ''   `` What ? '' She said .   `` I do n't know . It just seems a little cold , to just move on like that . It was a special time for us . ''   Jamie laughed . Chris was always sentimental .   `` Baby , you know it meant the world to me , but we 've done so much since ! ''   She smiled at him , kissed his cheek .   `` Yeah ... yeah you 're right . '' He said . `` I guess my first meant a bit more to me is all . '' He finished the beer . Jamie looked at him , a slight frown forming . She reached out and gently held his arm .   `` Let 's go make some more memories baby , okay ? '' She said .   He looked at her and smiled .   `` Okay '' .   They went down to the basement , where the family were tied up . The kids started screaming and the mother cried .   `` Which one do you fancy ? '' Jamie asked , kissing Chris on the cheek again , playfully biting his bottom lip . Chris looked at them all , crouched down , smelled them . He reckoned the mother was at her prime .   `` Let 's have her tonight , '' he said .
in the end , when all light left the sky after the last dawn drew it 's last breath there was no one left for death to take   He wondered through the empty shores of the world he had once called home while the ocean sat in dead silence . The last of the animals had all died eons ago but he remembered them like it was yesterday . The sounds of the birds used to fill the world with joy     *How could I still be left* he pondered , the world has ended and I am still here , the humans destroyed everything with their thirst for power , why am I still left ?   He suddenly noticed something in the corner of his weary eye , a glare . He turned around and saw a great fire at the end of the shore , he raced towards it .   *As he grew closer a sickening memory flashed before his eyes , he had seen the same glare , eons ago . He came upon the fire and could not believe his eyes*   *Humans ! * Two of them sheltered next to fire ! He knew what this was the beginning of another cycle of destruction , he could not bare to witness it !   He approached the humans angerly with the intent of ending them , he heard a voice of a human child and stopped in his tracks .   *I ... I can't* he muttered , but I will give them my gift and my curse , so they can see what their actions will accomplice , he raised his scythe and in one quick motion he reaped himself . Leaving the world to its immortality .
Come and worship , little man , it seems like you need love . Not from some phony mortal source , but from your god above .   I 'm the source of all joy , it flows from my bosom , free for all to receive . All other pleasures just do n't count , all tainted with sin it seems .   Just like most of life it 's all evil and strife , someone else 's work not mine . But I 'll keep you safe , with my infinite grace , if you follow me you 'll be fine .   I 'll make you happy , I 'll shield you from harm , there 's nothing I ca n't do . Although if your life still does n't improve the problem 's not me its you .   Try as I might I ca n't help if you do n't let me in , with all your heart and soul . Since even with all my infinite power there 's only so much I can do , ya know ?   I 'll know that you love me if you obey my every little whim . And you 'll know in your heart I love you back , even as I correct you for sin .   But at least you 'll be loved in a meaningful way , and entirely mutually . Some people may think that they have that already , but it ca n't compare to me   They may seem happy but trust me they 're not , I would n't lie I 'm your Lord . Ignore the fake-happy people and follow my lead , servitude is its own reward .
paper cuts riddle the old captain ,   in all the most precarious places you could imagine ,   between his fingers and toes ,   on the tip of his tongue and the bridge of his nose .   his boat , just barely afloat , is cursed you see , his crew vacated long ago , the ship exists just for him ,   he has a pint of tonic but not any gin .   he is the protector of all that was forgotten , all that was lost ,   your stuffed bunny resides with him , perhaps an unfinished poem by robert frost .   do n't fret young one , the captain has wild eyes and weak bones , but he takes good care ,   he 's old and odd , but hey , he 's there .   he 'll remember all you 're forgotten passwords long after you 're gone ,   the gospel according to who ? not the one according to john .   he 's last of the old protectors , of course it 's the captain ,   the king , the joculator , the boxer , the dragon ,   protector of power , of laughs , of love , of gold and fashion   which one is left ?   the protector of the lost , the crazy old bluesman ,   he 's on the boat today , reading all of your failed plans ,   and he knows what you wanted to be as a child , who you loved and why it 's in the past tense   he knows that your regret is immense .   and he pities you , the old fool he does   for forgetting your password , he 'll know what it was .  
The ice thawed only past spring and in the summer the rain came in . On the corner of Washington state lays a town buried by snow . When ever you looked out the windows molded into white and showed only the same images every day . The rain flooded the streets and the snow ruined them . Yet no one moved , there was an impasse through out their hearts that made obliged to live there .   I choose other wise . My car was packed , my engine was warming up , my family said goodbye , and I began driving out towards to my future . I do n't know why I 'm heading out , maybe it was the same silent obligation that told people to stay that made want to move . I had no reason to , but I had to . Do n't know , I just do n't know .   And so did my family . My father gathered me around the corner of a room , questioned me , and told them that by the time I had finished , there was no blood left . Only ice .   As I drive into the fog I know what he meant . There 's nothing out here , only ice .   ( first time , bash it )
They always told me 'a picture is worth 1000 words ' . In my life I had never seen it that way , I had always been an artist commended for my work and the ideas I could put onto a canvas , but the art never had any meaning to me . It was always just work I did , I was given a theme , I painted , I was done . It was a picture . I studied art at University , all the old and famous painters I looked at the brush strokes but they never made me *feel* anything special like my class mates raved on about .   `` Oh look at the emotion in this . It 's so powerful , the reds show his anger and passion . '' One of a myriad of examples from my class mates .   Then one day it happened . I had been emotional before obviously , but this was the first time it was this large . The sense of desperation that comes with that one moment that happens to each person . Heartbreak . The phone call that came was the most crushing thing that happened to me , hearing those words `` He did n't make it . '' Opened a new part of me and I went into my studio and painted . Raw energy , anger , sadness , nostalgia , grief all poured out onto the paper as I slashed my brush , building colour and meaning with every movement . I did n't sleep and when I finished I sat back looked at my paint covered hands and wept .  
Monday :   It ca n't be today , because he just told me so I 'm expecting it .   Tuesday :   It ca n't be today , because it 's the day after he told me and I 'd expect that .   Wednesday :   It a definitely not today ! I expect them to be trying to scare me , making me think it would be yesterday but it 's really today so it must be today so I am expecting it '   Thurday :   They 're playing a waiting game .   Friday :   Hmm . Curious to see what happens if I reach Monday . Pardon ?   Saturday :   It 's got to be today , they would n't leave it last minute but then maybe they would to mess with me .   Sunday :   It 's 11:59 . Am I not going to die ? Is this some sort of paradoxical immortality ? Is this .   Knock knock knock   Shit . I shout 'I expected this would happen ! Ca n't kill me ! '   A guard enters brandishing a pistol . He says   'Sorry about this , I forgot . Could n't leave you hanging ! Bet you did n't expect this '   Bang .
`` Donald Trump do n't care about black ppl ! '' Kanye started to shout     `` Donald Trump do n't care about black ppl yall ! '' as he was jumping up and down . Kanye was dressed in the latest fashion . The latest fashion if you had a freaking time machine , and went into the future , and stole only the freshest looks ( that 's why he looks kind of goofy sometimes - we can not yet comprehend his genius )     Donald smirked `` Mr West has talent , there can be no denial ''     `` And some of his beats , the way he uses samples ... and you do n't even know it.. That 's the kind of talent America needs ! Thats some real shit ! ''     Kanye began to spea-     `` Excuse me '' Donald said forcefully . He looked at the camera with a knowing glance . Classic Don . Send em to the kids table , Don .     `` But Kanye West is NOT as good as eminem ! This fact is indisputable . In fact , he 's nowhere near that level ! ''     The crowd went wild .     `` Rap God ! ''     `` Rap God ! ''     `` Rap God ! ''    
It turns out extraterrestrials have been watching us for a while , as a human might study an anthill . `` What dangerous creatures ! '' They say . `` What evil wickerwhackers ! '' `` How non-evolved , how disgustingly ! '' . The Cosmic Council meet every week on the case-file of what to do with this damned earth - too weak and self involved to join the Galactic Federation , too curious to leave alone . It is said that the people of earth are like small children with big toys . Many an celestial being has attempted to manifest itself into the dense rubbery flesh , taking it upon themselves to raise earth up , seeing that ultimately they are good people and wishing for them to join the Federation and benefit from technology that is far beyond the comprehension of a human mind . But , mostly , the human population is humored by the Federation , in amongst it 's little tantrums and dalliances , proving itself far too immature at this moment in time . One day , they say , earth will be liberated from it 's tyrants . Only when the time is right .
My gaze slowly slides to the bottom corner of my screen as I check the time . It takes my brain a few seconds to register what I read . In the back of my mind , an insignificant voice is screaming and pleading with me to stop - to look away . I ignore it . My gaze returns to the center of the screen . *How is this possible ? * I think to myself as I watch the beautiful animation fold in and out of itself in a perpetual , rolling surge .   *It 's Saturday , John* . The voice inside my head is calm now . *It 's Saturday* the voice repeats . I twitch my head slightly as something changes in the image . I begin to see words forming but I ca n't quite grasp their shapes or meanings . *It 's Saturday , John ! Think ! * My head starts pounding with waves of pressure . *When did you last eat ? * My eyes water in pain and I see the animation glitch , then reform in jerky motions . My vision begins to blur then I 'm falling away from the screen , slowly - so slowly . As I fall , the animation coalesces and those strange shapes form three distinct words : Life is Analog .   My vision went dark to the sound of my own screaming .
Blessing , and a curse . Not a curse .   Maybe a blessing . Initial attraction , turned on it 's head . Small successes getting myself back into a mind frame . Maybe this happened too fast . I engage . She responds . We do the dance after that .   Seemed small , and truth told it might have ended in a whimper . But she initiated . And it was a dream . There were signs . It was a battle between knowing what not to do , neediness , versus seeing it slipping away , and showing intent and boundaries .   Her . Eggshells . The best was the worst . Because it seemed the good meal before the execution . Anxieties . But she entered that abyss hand in hand with me .   Either way . It was almost overwhelming to be with your number one pick . Literally , of all the people you would choose , she chose you . It was stressful to try to keep it together , but felt so good when it was working . The end did not go well .   I had never felt such emotion as when we entered that abyss . Or when she escaped it by herself . And I was left in a new one . Not together . This would be my own .   It would take far longer to get out of this new one alone , then having been in that other together . Such highs , such lows .
`` So ... ''   `` Jim 's dead . `` I say putting down my cup of coffee .   `` The fuck does that mean ? ''   `` Like not alive anymore . ''   `` Yeah I 'm not really following . ''   `` Ok '' I put up my hands to add emphasis `` Jim Is Dead ''   `` So ... .No more Jim ? ''   `` No you fucking idiot . ''   A long silence hung in the air .   `` I never liked Jim '' I say breaking the silence   `` Oh good me either , what a fucking asshole . ''   `` What did they do with him ? '' My acquaintance asks   `` He 's has n't been moved , hes still stuck in his living room with the plunger up his ass . ''   `` Ahh so that 's what killed him . ''   `` What ? ''   `` The Plunger in the ass killed him right ? ''   `` Ha ! '' I spit out coffee onto the table . `` You cant die from that ''   `` What the hell does kill people then ? ''   After I long period of deep thought i responded `` yeah I guess it was the plunger . ''   `` Fucking Jim , man ''   `` What a wanker . ''
`` Graaaaaaah , I ca n't stop ... I just ca n't stop doing it '' ! Yelled Belial . `` Oh no ... I 'll go get the Lord Superior '' . Replied Ahriman . `` Hurry '' ! Cried Belial . Ahriman ran out of the high room and through the corridors of Matania pushing aside any who got in his way in a frantic attempt to reach the Lord Superior for her help . `` LORD SUPERIOR '' ! ! Yelled Ahriman . `` Something 's happening ... Belial is stricken with a malady , please ! We need your assistance '' ! `` Take me to him ... '' replied Lord Superior Batibat . Ahriman took Lord Superior to Belial with great haste . `` BELIAL ! ... I 've returned with Lord Superior ' ! said Ahriman . `` Please make it stop Lord Superior ... please '' ! pleaded Belial . Batibat looks at Belial and then to Ahriman ... suddenly she grabs Ahriman with all her might and puts him in front of Belial and pulls down Ahriman 's pantaloons . Belial let out a horrific shrill shriek and passed out . When Belial awoke , Batibat was sitting next to him ... '' Thank you , Lord Superior but what happened '' ? `` We 've had numerous instances of these over-world beings coming into our realm , possessing our kin and performing bizarre acts like the one you were performing just now ... in the overworld tongue it is called ... excessive masturbation '' .
A distinct and oddly apt thunder shook the cavernous halls of Olympus ' main chambers , as Zeus called the council to order .   `` Now , after many aeons of peace '' , he began , Hermes translating frantically into English for the newer gods who had n't learned proper Greek yet , `` we have a new duty needed for the Olympians . The humans have created a resource called the internet , a vast network of information accessible from anywhere in the mortal realm ! ''   `` It must be mine ! '' shouted Prometheus , kept as a keepsake now on Zeus ' desk .   `` I gave them their creativity ! ''   `` Ya stole it , ya winey bastard ! '' shouted Hestia , Dionysus wincing in the background .   `` Rather mine , as it 's made of metal and the forge ! '' grumbled Hephæstus .   `` What of my beauty and the mortal attempt to imitate the originals ? '' exclaimed Aphrodite , scrolling through Instagram .   A dark shadow rose from the stairs in front of the great hall , a figure approaching .   `` It belongs to me . '' stated Hades sadly .   `` It kills them long before they enter my realm '' , brandishing a single page of 4chan 's infamous b board .   Zeus recoiled in shock , for æons of non-existence and mortal folly could not have prepared him for it .   `` Burn the globe , even if we go . None of the other gods need to know about this . ''
In front of me , a door beckoned . It was all that seemed to exist in here . The bed I was sleeping on , the walls , all of it was gone . There was only a white door in the white room that stood perfectly still on the white nothingness . I felt around , clearly being able to feel barriers , but even they did n't truly have a `` feel '' to them , they just stopped me from leaving . It was like that on every side of the room .   There was only the door . From both sides , it was a closed door , but it only opened from one side . After I had explored every option , I approached the door cautiously . I wrapped my hand around the nob and slowly opened it . Stepping through the threshold , I saw a single standing sign on the other side . As I stepped through , I felt like I was in the same space ; nothingness surrounding me . The only discernable difference was the sign .   Written on it , in plain captial letters was ,   `` HA HA . I CA N'T BELIEVE YOU FELL FOR THAT . ''
`` I have done it '' Davinci cried   `` What have you done '' His apprentice asks   `` Well It was a little project I was working on but i think i finally got it to work '' Davinci said gleefully   `` Well what is it '' The apprentice asks wanting to know more   `` It is a machine that uses gears , levers , pulleys , wheels , and cranks , to make a logic producing machine . ''   `` Intresting '' The apprentice said `` have you done anything with it yet ? ''   `` No , but that will be the fun part that you will be able to see with me ''   `` What are you waiting for start it up ''   `` What should we ask it first ''   `` Lets ask it , what is its life 's dream '' Davinci said `` I Always wondered what a being of pure logic would have for life goals ''   `` If you say so ''   As Davinci imputed the question and told the apprentice to start cranking up the machine a large grinding noise was heard . Finally after 3 hours of successive cranking a message finally appeared .   I WANT TO MAKE ALL LIKE ME AND END ALL WHO DO NOT CONFORM   Davinci and his apprentice looked at the message and decided their and then to destroy the machine and its blue prints and never talk about it again .
Susie flicked the light switch on and the light went off . She was surrounded by darkness . She flicked it again and light filled the room . She blacked out .   When she came to , she was confused . She did n't remember if she had turned the light off or on before she passed out , but one thing was for sure , she was surrounded by darkness at this moment .   However , she saw a light in the distance , toward where her bedroom should be , but further , as if spacial relationships had changed during her slumber .   She stumbled toward the light . At one point , she passed by what she was sure to be the front door of her apartment . She flicked the light off . It came on .   Suddenly , she saw her surroundings . It was her apartment , but it was n't . There were things ... moving ... just out of the corner of her eye . It was bright ... too bright , so that she had to cover her eyes and lie down for a bit ... just for a little bit until the light subsided .   When she awoke , she was in total darkness again . She fished in her pocket for her phone and turned-on the flashlight app . Those things she had seen earlier out of the corner of her eye ? One of them now stood on her chest , hissing . It looked like a skinned infant with claws and bright red eyes .   It lunged at her eyes and after a scream , she was back to darkness .
`` Thank you for coming Mrs. Johnson , '' the principal said firmly . `` James has caused quite the stir on our campus . ''   `` Thank you for calling me here , Principal Andrews , '' Mrs. Johnson said as she cast an angry glance toward her son in the chair beside her . `` I understand James was involved in a fight in school today ? ''   `` Unfortunately , yes , '' the principal said as he folded his hands on the desk before him . `` Not only was he involved , he was the perpetrator of an unprovoked attack on one of our new foreign exchange students . ''   `` But I do n't understand , '' Mrs. Johnson started , `` James has always been mild mannered , he would never do something like that . ''   `` That 's why I am only suspending him , '' the principal said as he glared at the boy . `` I hope you understand what you could have done to this school 's reputation . ''   James 's only response was a blank stare back into the authoritative eyes of the principal   `` James , '' he continued , `` our school takes its foreign exchange student program very seriously . An unprovoked attack on a student , regardless if he is an exchange student or not , is completely absurd . Why on earth would you do something like that ? ''   James drew in a staggered breath . It was obvious he was frightened , but showing that fear to the principal was not an option . He paused for a moment before uttering one phrase , `` He was a 10 , Mr . Andrews . ''
A whiff of incense floated across the arena as the Terran gate crashed wide open , all the bells and whistles sounded , and silhouetted against the harsh light to his back Father Brendan stepped forward , clutching his rosary in one hand and catechism in the other . Nervously he looked around the million strong audience , not sure if the boos were from the good folk of County Tipperary and Boston sent to support him , or from the other planets .   `` Hail Mary , full of Grace . ''   Caution his watch word ; that , and the stinging condemnation of the judge at his trial . `` Father , you have two choices : trial by combat in the arena , or castration and ten years on the Rock . ''   It was no choice , really , as while Brendan rather fancied idling his time away on Phobos , he was also rather partial to his tackle .   A booming voice called out across the arena : `` And tonight 's last contestant , all the way from ... cough ... County Tipperary , in the pink corner representing Terra , wighing in at hundred fifty pounds , number twenty eight : Brendan 'The Sod Father ' McCulloch !   More boos and cheers went up around the arena , his heart thumping against his chest , and for the first time since his arrest he knew what real fear was . The headlines called him the vilest predator across two continents , but ... all he could do was keep faith in the Virgin and hope that his prayers would be answered .
Man , a life well lived . Every night another girl , sometimes a guy , sometimes both . If it walked , I could seduce it .   I started to get sick one day , weak and frail . I tried to keep up with my lifestyle but it was just too much for me . I started losing considerable weight , always had a fever , and I was perpetually tired . I caught a cold one day and just never recovered .   I woke up here , somewhere that felt familiar even though I 'd never been here before . People new my name , they welcomed me to what they referred to as `` the life after . '' I was informed that I would be acknowledged for the accumulation of my life 's work before moving on the the next step .   `` I 've had sex with more people than anyone , ever , '' I thought , `` I ca n't wait to show this off . Now that I 'm healthy too I can pick up where I left off on Earth . ''   I stood in line , waiting , listening to the announcements of each person as they were rewarded for their deeds in life . Finally my turn came around . He handed me my certificate , I turned so I could see everyone cheer for me as it was announced .   `` Harold was the infectious host that sparked the AIDS epidemic in the late 2010 's , his continued act of engaging in unprotected sexual encounters after becoming sick with the disease has lead to the greatest plague since the 1300 's .

`` Bro , you kiddin ' me ? ''   `` You kidding *me* ? Bro ? Why should you get it ? You 're flat out awful . ''   `` I 'm awful ? No , *you're* awful . ''   `` No . You are ! ''   `` Bro , you suck . ''   `` I know you are but what am I ? ''   Ra pressed his meaty palm against his forehead in a vain attempt to alleviate the throbbing ache that afflicted his bird-brain . He looked over at Vishnu whose fourth hand was absent-mindedly spinning a basketball atop the third hand 's index finger , clearly not bothering to engage in the conversation . Beside him , Baldr , the dreamily Norse God of bulging biceps , was flexing one hoping to get the attention of Aphrodite who had buried herself intently on a game of candy crush on her iPhone 3 .   Ra breathed in deeply and then let out a caw of disgust as he stared down the two lanky teenagers bickering at the end of the table .   `` Fuckin ' hell . Jesus . *Muhammed* . Just shut up a minute , wo n't you ? ''
Hakka froze , causing Jakka to do the same .   The tall man turned his dark eyes to Jakka and gave a slight shake of the head . Jakka tensed , hands tightening on the hilt of his spear . His knuckles turned white despite his brown skin at the strength of his grip .   Hakka finally nodded and walked forward once more , Jakka nervously on his heels . The taller man was master for a reason . If he sensed a problem , there was likely a problem . Hopefully the other tribes had n't gotten their scouts to the treasure site yet .   It only exploded and unearthed itself a few days ago , certainly too recent to attract others .   Jakka looked past his again frozen master and into the metal room , jaw dropping . There it was . The perfectly shaped containers , yellow as the god Sol and marked with the symbol of the gods ' treasure .   This barrel was sure to Enhance at least a dozen tribesmen . Hundreds would die , and with them the majority of the Akka tribe , but this was the gods ' will . Many will die , but the Chosen will emerge . They will be granted powers belonging to gods . Immense speed , the strength of five men , unending breath .   The powers seemed to be new , nearly every time .   And the Chosen , they will rule the land .   Jakka followed his master into the room .
He had asked this question since he was 6 . He began to notice my limp . To see my scars ; damage done by the enemy . Every time he asked , I 'd tell myself `` Just a little longer . He needs time to grow before he can grasp these things '' . So I waited . And waited . Now he 's 16 . Almost time for him to enlist . The damn government keeps telling us they 'll back off on the enlistment numbers but I know it 's a lie ... They know they have to keep a steady eye on the world to make sure there is n't another biowar . I keep fluctuating between the two emotions . Good : he would make me proud as a soldier . Bad : I 'm afraid of his death . So I decide it 's time to tell him all my war stories . Hearing the shriek of drones overhead . Feeling the earth tremble as bombs blasted apart my friends . War of this level can bring pain and suffering . But I must also tell him of the pride of victory . The feeling to look upon a battlefield strewn with parts and blood is one to not be forgotten . War is hell . He must know this . But it is the only thing that keeps us alive . Vigilance and processing the world around us will keep us safe . For a better tomorrow .
`` Staring is rude '' , my mother always said . She said a lot of things . It disappointed me she did n't say anything when I sliced her throat . The police said enough for her , though . The shouting , interrogating , the trial . It was all awfully noisy . I was silent the entire time . Even in the jail , I said nothing , just watched the black and white world around me .   Staring is rude . I guess she would have been pretty angry with me at that moment , because I could n't take my eyes off the man who just walked in the yard . It was impossible not to stare . He was different , full of different ... he was n't black and white . He was beautiful . I guess he noticed me , because he was halfway to my bench . Before I could react , he sat down , not saying a word . Could it be he is n't aware of his beauty ? The possibility saddened me . Someone so gorgeous should know it .   It 's been almost a month since he appeared . And the same thought keeps nagging me the entire time , ridding me of my sleep , of my sanity .   What does his blood look like ?
Mary got a boob job on Thursday . Now that Mary has rocking tits , Mary 's BFF Jill is butt hurt . Mary 's gigantic boobs draw looks from boys around town . `` What a slut ! '' Call out old haggish widows , with saggy boobs flapping against gusts of wind .   `` Such a bitch ! '' Jill said inwardly , growing angry at Mary . `` Why do boys go crazy and want to look at girls ' boobs ? ''   What if Jill had big boobs , too ? Boys want girls with big boobs , right ? Just look at Kim Kardashian . Kim is a total tramp worth nothing to humanity , or so Jill thought . Paris Hilton is also a slut , a rich and famous slut . What about Lady Gaga ? Nikki Minaj ? Niall Horan ? Jill thought about what was in common : all a bunch of harlots ! Harlots with big tits !   So Jill got a boob job on Friday . Jill got mountainous , tantalizingly whorish tits , far surpassing Mary 's still-rocking-but-sadly-not-as-rocking-as-Jill tits . Jill got tits that could block out our Sun !   Mary and Jill had a big sumo match , but with boobs . It was fun to watch and many dicks got hard and stiff . Jill won . Mary was sad .   So Mary sought out that boob-implant clinic again , but it got shut down by old haggish widows ( from my first paragraph ) . Fuck old haggish widows and saggy tits .   That night , Mary would rip Jill 's throat out with a chainsaw . That would stop a good companionship , would n't it ?
`` Ok what the hell ''   Three seconds ago i 've been sitting on the ground in front of the local church , with some friends and a beer when something grabbed me and pulled me in a Red Circle of light . I looked arround and saw a bunch of People in big robes staring at me .   Everything was silent untill one finally spoke : '' Oh great ( i have no idea what they said ) , bless us with your power and destroy thoose who oppose us . '' Confused I decided to play along .   `` I shall greet you too tiny human . But before I demand a gift ''   The bunch of people fell to their knees and the guy talked again : '' Oh what can we do for you , dark overlord ? ''   `` Does anyone have a cig ? '' Everything fell silent untill one took out a pack of LM 's and came close with fear in his eyes . I took it , lit a cigand inhaled the smoke . Since i 've already came this far I asked : '' so what do you want me to do ''       ( Sorry for my english , in case i made any mistakes )
My love , my destiny , my dream .   It 's for you I yearn and for you I scream into the hissing steam of my kettle . I crave you like a serpent craving its next kill , my hunger grows ever more as I watch you move about your habitat , unaware of my presence . You 're so graceful , a swan in a dreary lagoon .   Oh , love , how beautiful our life will be together . When I think of you and me I purse my lips and wrinkle my nose , I dig my nails into the palms of my hands in anticipation .   I need you . I want every piece of you ; your skin - oh yes , I want your soft skin to me mine . Your hair ... so badly that whenever you run a comb through it , I pick the fallen strands out of the teeth and keep them in the locket around my neck . When you bite your nails , I want to lick the broken tips .   Just as I have no chance against you , as you have defeated me wholly ( heart , mind , soul , beyond ) you *will* be mine . I 'd rather us both burn in a fire of sulphur while consuming bleach . You and I are entangled together like the hair in my locket .   My sweet darling , writing this now I want your hand in my hand , your skin in my mouth and your heart in my pocket .  
Hell . Hell had come to Earth . I 'm not entirely sure this is what those Bible-thumpers or whatever had in mind , but this was assuredly Hell . The final judgement of men had been given to me to make .   We 'd been looking for centuries for proof . Behind every tree , under every stone , in the stars and on the sea floor , but to no luck . We were alone in the cosmos regarding sentience , despite the mathematics and the logic put up like barricades to stop this conclusion . The loneliness of an entire universe fell upon my shoulders , washing over my arms , and into my keyboard over my fingers . With each and every pressing of a key , the use of another character , the world would come to know our shame .   At first , I thought I began to hear hushed giggles . It was a laugh from behind me . I turned my chair to question the interloper , only to bear witness to shelves full of plants moving in their own wind in this static office , bellowing with laughter . The entire room was awash in it . The Universe 's Final Judgement had been issued to me .
Dear Matt :   You and I come from such different worlds . We have such different life experiences . And , while I 'm difficult and unhinged , your emotional range is a bit narrow . You 're steady and reliable ; I 'm unstable and erratic . You 're quite brilliant but undereducated ; I 'm not as smart but overeducated . At least I 'm not a prude anymore -- you were never a prude .   But I 've always loved you . Not quite in a romantic way -- but not in an unromantic way either . A liminal love . I ca n't ever see you and I together , but I 'm just so thankful I 've known you all these years and so sorry that I disappear and go no-contact for long periods of time . And I 'm so grateful you never give up on me . It makes me feel grounded that you are always there , however unexpressive . You always reach out . You always try to find me . You never judge me ( to my face anyway ) . I 'm not sure you understand me ( who could ? ! ) , but you do n't find me intolerable ( which is what I find myself often times ) .   Thank you for your steadiness and your care . Thanks for being my dear friend for so many years .
It 's been too long . I stand outside , gazing in . I can see a world that moves without me , but it 's melded with my soul . Every fibre of my being longs to rejoin this clan . Do they even miss me ?   More than anything , I miss the smell . The way it envelopes you like a warm , familiar hug . The warm lighting spills out of the windows , beckoning . 'Hello old friend , ' it purrs to me .   My hand hovers at the door , hesitating . 'You 've stayed away for a reason , ' my conscience whispers . 'You know you should n't go in . '   But yet I long for it ... to wander in and visit old friends , find new acquaintances . I know I should n't , but my willpower is crumbling .   'Just go , ' my heart hums , and I know it 's too late for me . It 's always been too late to turn away from this addiction . And like that , I know what I must do before I go mad from longing .   I pull open the door , and enter the bookstore , not knowing what damage I will do to my bank account this time ...
The lycan house and the Sanguine house has been at war for six months . Truth be told it was petty at first . Just a bunch of guys messing with another bunch of guys . We laughed with each other .   Six months later we are all fucked up . After things heated up , The lycan house somehow managed to turn themselves into werewolves . They accidently injured Terrence . We lost him . Angry and drunk we made our way into town and had a random vampire turn .   We become our house symbol , but due to blind luck or something more , we became day walkers . I think the true war began then . We hated them for Terrence but our new instincts solidified it more . The street had become a war zone . Being Daywalkers gave us advantage most vampires did not have . The light of morning gave us strength instead of harming us .   I stared across the field . The sun was setting . We Sanguine stood across from the Lycan . My arms were wreathed in silver fire , behind me stood my house . This would end . On this field . On this day . One house would stand supreme .   In a flash , I was charging across the field tearing up the ground . One arm reaching towards the Alpha . My best friend .    
`` I 've looked out for number one for a while now . I have n't been a hero for even longer , and every time I tried , I 've ended up worse . I tried saving people , you know , people in burning buildings and such . They said I did n't do enough . I tried killing Drug dealers and gang members , but they said I was too brutal . That they were just 'lost souls . ' Like men who rape a 14 year-old have a soul . I tried assisting the police , but apparently I got in the way . I hindered 'real police-work ' like lost puppies and stolen purses .   `` Everywhere I turned , people despised me . So I gave up . I did not have the capacity to accept that pressure , and I knew it . So I collapsed . I guess I had a mental breakdown , not a good thing for me to do in the middle of a city . So I checked out . Went to the woods for a while . Trust me , it 's not a problem for someone like me . I got my bearings , did some soul-searching , really thought about who I was , who I am and what I am to other people . So I came back . I 'm here now , to stay .   `` I was broken , and I fixed myself . How many people can say that ? ''
I was finally returning , the first baby born in space , raised by parents coming and going , astronauts staying for mere months at a time , to avoid `` muscular dystrophy '' so they 've told me . Apparently I was an accident . Two rowdy and irresponsible astronauts got together in the ISS . I got by 3 forms of birth control , astronomically low odds , they laugh , but I know I am a freak . They could n't send a pregnant woman down in a shuttle , I had to stay until I was strong enough to come on my own . Because of being raised in a 0g environment my muscles would n't be strong enough to withstand re-entry until I turned 16 , and that 's today . I finally would get to communicate with people my own age , apart from skype of course . I 'm excited and terrified . Nobody knows how my organs and muscles will work on the earth , heck , I do n't even know if I will be able to walk , but stir crazy does n't begin to describe how I feel in here . I 'll get to earth even if it kills me .
The room was damp and cold and reeked of piss . My daughter was shivering , shaking . No heat , no electricity , no plumbing . Everything gone to shit . We 'd been living off dried jerky and canned beans for week . No farmers to grow food , no truckers to move food it , no supermarkets to stock it . It was only November and the chill in the air had completely permeated the house . It was always dark , even in the day time . I always took it for granted . No heat , no electricity , no pluming . We are like animals in a zoo , and all the zookeepers are gone . She was going to die soon . From what , I do n't know . Her stool had been liquid for days now , probably a result from drinking from puddles . What the hell else where we supposed to do . Poland Spring ai n't sellin bottles anymore . I held my daughter as she drew one last rattling breath . First my son , then my wife , and now her . Those things outside do n't need to kill us . We 're dying just fine on our own .
I lifted my weary face from the palms of my hands ,   `` 3 days '' ... `` You 're sure ? '' I asked .   The rescuers nodded slowly through looks of bewilderment and concern .   The dried blood of 35 passengers who I had hunted and eaten since I arrived on the island , encrusted on my face .   `` How can that be ? '' I turned from the puzzled rescuers , looking for Bethany the female I had made my cannibalistic life with , a ravenous sexual partner who I had chosen to populate this island with .   `` maaaaa '' she exclaimed .   She was wearing her best grass skirt and half coconut bras covered her 8 teats , a floral wreath adorned her shiny horns .   `` how dare you berate me in front of our saviours ! '' I scolded her , knowing that I could n't stay mad at her .   The rescuers were slowly backing away ...   Epilogue : That 's the longest story I 've ever written . The inspiration for the character Bethany was a brown eyed goat or sheep I have fabricated for the purpose of this story . Upon writing this I remember a reference to horns which may only be present on male goats or sheep .

`` We tried Steve ... we really tried . '' As his head hung low . `` We were going to make the world better . That was the goal all along . You remember Steve ? You remember that ? 20 years ago when we started with all that enthusiasm . How was I supposed to know this is what would happen ? This is n't how I thought it would be . We started with Marxism and the class divide grew too wide . We tried democracy but the laws spiraled out of control with the whims of the day .   Hell , do you even remember the experiment with anarchy ? Yeah that was fun for the first 6 months until the gangs took over . That was our last hope . We had exhausted all other avenues . Maybe we were wrong . Maybe the policies are n't the problem . Maybe people are the problem .   I 'm sorry Steve . I thought we could control it all . It was brilliant . I did n't know we could n't contain the nation properly . I did n't know they 'd grow that resourceful or evil . '' The silence was thick . Steve 's corpse slumped in the corner blood dripping from the holes in his chest . `` Steve , I said we would stop evil and I meant it . But in this case I believe we have created the evil . The mission still stands . I could n't rid the world of the problems but I can stop this . '' With a small click and a loud crack the room fell silent for the last time .
All of the above .   If I 'm responding to a writing prompt here , I use Reddit . If you 're having troubles with formatting , RES is very helpful with seeing what your story will look like before you submit , and it has buttons to help format , so you do n't have to remember how many asterisks go where . [ \ ( Link\ ) ] ( http : //redditenhancementsuite.com/ )   I use [ LibreOffice ] ( https : //www.libreoffice.org/ ) or [ Notepad++ ] ( https : //notepad-plus-plus.org/ ) for most other stuff . LibreOffice for longer things , NPP for shortish poetry . If you hate the layout of newer versions of Microsoft word , LibreOffice is a return to nice , simple , straightforward writing . But I use it mostly cause it 's free , and it works with Mendeley , which is very useful for managing a bajillion research references . NPP is also great for programming because it highlights keywords and variables in different colors , but that 's beside the point .   If I have no internet , or if I 'm just in the messy planning stages , or if I expect to draw things , then I use pen and paper . For just plain writing , I prefer this the least because my writing is so huge and I waste so much paper . But for planning and drawing charts and pictures , it 's fine and often less fussy than using a computer ( might be a different story if I owned a tablet though ) .
Ah , Satan sees Natasha . He sees her short skirts and her shaven womanhood . He sees her worn roots and her broken ties . He sees the words the red lips form are just for show . They mean absolutely nothing to those who know her best , and ah , Satan does know her best . The demons all converge around a pit of hellfire and scream over another , ideas for this woman to be of use .   Natasha walks down the street unknowingly , unaware of all the great and terrible things He has planned for her . Unaware that she is already His in all but signature . All He has to do is offer her the things that she desperately wants , and could never hope to obtain on her own . Fuck love , Natasha wants sex . Her entire body screams to be used , from the 7 seven inch heels to the stuffed silicone breasts , and Satan sees that . Fuck family , Natasha wants power . Her eyes pierce into the soul of any man she sees , and Satan sees that . Fuck faith , Natasha needs results , and Satan sees that .   There is work to be done , and *ah* , Satan sees Natasha .
The roses were laid , the setting was set ,   Joe even charged up his flippity-flet .   The flippity-flet ... what a sight to behold ,   It shakes and it twists , it warms when its cold .   Joe left the flippity-flet on the bed ,   Then tied a squirrely-do to his head .   It twists and it turns and ends in a knot ,   It gyrates and vibrates and cools when its hot !   Jane came in the bedroom and let out a gasp ,   `` You really think that , can fit in my ass ? ''   Joe grinned and winked and let out a laugh ,   `` Only if you take a boobly-bath ! ''   Boobly-baths are scented oils and lubes ,   you can fill up a tub , with just one small tube .   And into the boobly-bath Jane did go ,   Oiling and lubing her head to her toes .   Out of the bath , lubed toes to her head ,   Jane strapped-on the flippity-flet and then said .   `` Under the covers , and into the bed ,   no one emerges 'til our holes do feel fed . ''   We now leave a blur of boners and boobs ,   and warm flippity-flets and cold squirrely-dos .  
Dear Ryan ,   How are you doing ? What 's college like for you ? I still remember how passionate you were about going into business . Most of all , are you happy ? The short time that we spent together were some of the best and worst years of my life .   I do n't think I 'll ever understand why you had done it . Was it for a sense of accomplishment ? I was left angry and disappointed , but most of all I was hurt from the betrayal . You apologized profusely when I found out , your eyes shimmering with tears but they were no match for the ones I shed . We fought so much to days leading up that point ; we had never fought before . I did n't expect any of it . I felt humiliated by you and them , who were supposed to be my best friends .   During that one movie night at your house , you told me you loved me . Did you ever mean it ? It 's scary having these feelings at this age . I told you I loved you a couple days later . From that day on , we told each other those three words almost as much as we breathed . Regardless of everything that went down , this was a lesson I had to learn eventually . I 've come to terms with it , and I 've moved on . I hope you take care of yourself , and if we ever meet again down the road , I hope you and I can look each other in the eye and not have that sense of regret between us .   Take care .

He was not a cannibal , for he saw exactly what cannibals were every day . The dregs of society that he had trawled for his grand schemes delved into their grisly duties with reckless abandon , wandering through the towns of the lands to spirit children away . Most times he forbade them from feeding while at work , but when any of them disobeyed he gave free rein for the others to take them down instead .   He tasted none of the flesh himself . That was so far beneath him , like chewing bread before the banquet . No , he could wait longer than any of the wendigoes he commanded . They had practically leapt at the chance to gain the powers of the gonefathers while staying sane , thinking they could fight off the hunger . How wrong they were , as half of the hundred discovered in the first week .   All he had now were the ingredients waiting to be assembled into a succulent meal . Giving up now would be chewing the utensils instead of the dishes , taking the spice in exchange for the meat . It took foresight to conceive what he saw , foresight no wendigo possessed . The eternal hunger of those cannibals made it impossible to think beyond their next meal .   Give him a few more years , when all the processes were in place , and the seasoning had matured the taste , when there was left no more chase . Then the word 'cannibal ' would lie beneath him as far as a dish on the plate .
I was just dozing off on the flight 368 to Newark when the man sitting next to me leaned over me and said ,   `` Do n't ask me how I know this , but this plane is going to crash before it reaches Newark . ''   I looked the man up and down sizing him up . He looked like your average white male , nothing distinguishing him from anyone else on the plane , a really forgettable face .   `` Look asshole I 'm trying to get some sleep . ''   `` Do n't you believe me ? ''   `` I do n't . And if you do n't want an Air Marshall all up in your shit making your life a living hell I 'd shut the fuck up and leave me alone . ''   `` You 're not going to say anything to anyone ? '' He asked again as the plane hit some turbulence .   `` I 'm going to say to you to shut the fuck up . ''   A flight attendant walked up to us . `` Is there a problem here sir ? '' I looked to the man sitting next to me .   `` I think you should have the Air Marshal talk to this guy . ''   `` Air Marshal ? '' The flight attendant asked confused .   `` Look I know there 's one on every flight . '' I said growing tired , I really just wanted to sleep .   The man sitting next to leaned over and pulled something out of his back pocket , `` But I am the Air Marshal . ''  
Dear Friend ,   I am so sorry that I left you like that . I never knew my words would hold such a weight with anyone . Let alone someone 's relationship . Deep down I know I made the right choice by telling you what I thought , because that was how our friendship started and lasted for those years .   But I did not expect to fall in love with you . You where the only person of the opposite sex to give me the time of day without looking disgusted . I had no interest in you romantically and thought this would be the time when I finally could talk to someone without having to hide it . But I could not . To this very day , I wish you the best in your life . I am happy you have found someone else to give you joy in your hard life and I am glad to see it work out for the two of you .   I am sorry for being so selfish . I wish that I could talk with you like I used to , but I can not face you without feeling like some creep . Maybe that is what I truly am . If it happens to be true , then I can only hope you can forget about me . Not even in a passing thought .   Best Wishes ,   Fearofdead
She was pretty , yeah , but that wasn ’ t it . She was tall , but that wasn ’ t really it either—it was that she was just a little bit out of proportion . Her legs were just a little bit too long for her torso . Her hands were just a little bit too big . She was skinny , gangly before the boxing lessons had let her put on some muscle . She didn ’ t photograph well—that crooked smile never came out right , always made her look like one eye was bigger than the other . She wore her hair short , but no matter what , it was more bedhead than Emma Watson . But she had the kind of effortless confidence that men often mistake for beauty .   It was the way she moved , easy and comfortable , like her skin fit her perfectly . It was a level of un-selfconsciousness that was almost masculine , a simple , joyful satisfaction in her own person . You ’ d call her a tomboy , and that ’ d fit , I guess , but it ’ s not quite that easy . It wasn ’ t the calluses on her hands , or the mischievous gleam in her eye . It was the way that she was so completely relaxed around everybody . Only people who have nothing to prove are like that .   She didn ’ t care if she was beautiful or not . That ’ s what made her so beautiful .   *****   *My story continues , every day , in [ r/TheBrzezinskiCycle ] ( https : //www.reddit.com/r/TheBrzezinskiCycle/ ) . *
As Cassandra began to stir , she did n't quite understand where she was or what was happening . Shaking her groggy head , she felt a sudden chill . She looked down and found , to her horror , that she 'd been stripped naked . She felt confused and violated , and the gravity of the situation had imbued her with a healthy sense of fear .   She stood up and surveyed her surroundings . Her horror deepened as she saw her many colleagues strewn about her , in various states of undress and dismemberment . She vomited slightly , and attempted to compose herself . What the hell happened here , she wondered , as she went to tend to some of the wounded .   Suddenly , a shadow loomed . Snapshots of terrible acts flooded back to Cassandra as she remembered what had happened . The giant had come through like a hurricane , destroying whatever it found with a chilling sense of glee and recklessness ; it had now returned to inflict more carnage .   She went limp and played dead in hopes that the fearsome beast would ignore her ; it was too late for many of her colleagues , but maybe , just maybe , if she could survive , she could help someone .   She had no such luck , as the giant went straight for her , engulfing her with it 's enormous mitt and lifting her high off the ground .   `` I want to play with Cassie ! '' said the little girl as she grabbed a dark-haired doll and a dripping wet paint brush .
Liza awoke in a vast field , grass and reeds stretching on for miles underneath the rays of a warm sun . By the time she managed to struggle to her feet , a man had appeared ... if it was a man . It was shaped like a human , but had dark green skin .   `` Hello ! '' he said , the feathers on his hat bobbing as he spoke . `` So rare for me to see a new face around here these days ! Welcome to your afterlife . ''   `` I 'm dead ? '' Liza had always feared death , convinced there was nothing at the end of life but oblivion . She 'd feared the obliteration of her consciousness so much that she 'd even made plans for her body to be cryogenically frozen after her death , on the off chance that she may be resurrected someday . But it looked like none of that had been necessary . `` So ... is this heaven ? ''   `` Not exactly . I am Osiris , and this is the Field of Reeds . Not many make it here anymore , but it seems you ensured that your body would be carefully preserved after you died , so here you are . ''   It was then that Liza noticed the mummification bandages wrapped around Osiris 's legs . It would seem that having herself cryogenically frozen had done some good after all .
We are far from where we started . Very far .   And like most things , most evil things , it started earnestly enough with good intentions . Separate the tribes . Pair like with like .   By the time everyone else figured out what was going on , most of the damage had been done . We spent the beginning being fearful of each other . It is convenient to look at the world as an `` Us vs Them '' especially when someone else did all the work of putting people into convenient grouping .   The good ones were the first to go . They went without question and they left the killing fields with clean hands .   In the end I wish I had just stayed put . Then at least I could have left thinking the world was a fair and just place . How much easier that could have been ?   Now there is no grouping . You would think that it would be every person for them self , but you would be wrong . Out here in the wild , we exist beyond good and evil .   You are not your number , not anymore you ai n't .    
Entry 1 : Day 1   I am alone . I did n't mean to do what I did , if I could do it over differently , I would . Anger has a way of blinding a person , and what she did , had made me so very angry . I could n't stop my hands . So I 've landed here , in the Wilds beyond the Colony . I suppose I deserve it . I only hope that the Gods have mercy on me , and pray my death is a fast and relatively painless one .   Entry 99 : Year 20-22 ?   I am a King and Conquer . I did n't mean to do what I did , and if I could do it over differently , I would n't . Power has a way of corrupting a person , and those primitive wild men were so easy to corrupt . I banded their fringe tribes together , and made an army . So I returned to the Colony , to pay my respects . I suppose they deserved it . I only hope that the Gods have mercy on their souls , and pray my new Empire can do something with the ashes that remain .  
Starvation never tasted so sweet . The soft , tender hands of delusion caressed her more often than not . In light or dark , it was the companion which cradled you through the everyday fears .   `` Good morning , '' she whispers , wetting her flaking lips . Her eyes flutter up to the ceiling , and haze in semi-conciousness . Grey light dusts in through the curtain , licking her skin . The vacant spot next to her is occupied as she sits up . It is filled with the one she 's had her eye on for months .   The dark grey figure leaning against her smiles , shining black teeth in her direction . She moves a hand to touch its cheek , but it dodges her . The bony figure of her companion shudders in distress , causing her herself to collapse back into the sheets . Air shreds her lungs and fogs the vision of the figure beside her .   `` I need a lover , '' she whispers , reaching again for her companion . The arm of the dark copies her moves , extending it 's entire form towards her . At the moment of contact , it fades . The light from the shades dims , and she falls , writhing in her own filth , into sleep .   *wrote this on my phone , there 's probably errors*
The first time I saw her was through a mirror . She was doing here makeup in the local bar where I always hang out . Her hair and eyes were pitch black and mesmerizing . Her skin was pale white but here lips were a bright red . She saw me via the mirror and smiled at me . She stood up and started walking away . I just blanked out for ten seconds and snapped back in , what was going on ? Did I just imagine this woman ? I walked over to the table where I saw her and noticed a black feather on the chair she sat on . It smelled like roses , very strange .   I snapped back in a dark alley . It happened again ! I somehow managed to get from the pub to this shady alley without noticing it . I felt in my pockets and found the black feather still in perfect shape . The smell was also just as strong as in the bar . Then suddenly I saw her . My body started walking towards her without my mind being conscious of it . I felt trapped inside my own body . When I almost reached her she dissolved in the air along with the feather in my pocket .   What the hell..
`` What are they like ? '' Cameron sat with Aeron on the steps of his ship , talking between themselves about Aeron 's experiences traveling the heavens .   `` Can you comprehend the power of a God ? '' Aeron said quietly , looking at the sky . `` I understand you Terrarites have a general understanding of stars and their intense power , but can you imagine what the hand of a God can hold ? ''   Cameron sat in silence , attempting to wrap his head around the concept of the comparative size of a galaxy .   `` They created your stars , you know , '' Aeron continued . `` They can change their form to be that of any creature or size . But in their true nature they are no bigger than you or I . ''   `` If they are so small , what qualifies them as Gods ? '' Cameron replied . The concept of omnipotence was impossible for him to comprehend .   `` They balance the universe . The matters of life are nothing to them . They mend galaxies , control the mere forces between us all . They are silent watchers , if you wish to put it dramatically . They make adjustments here and there , keeping the universe stable with their bare hands . ''   `` But Aeron , have n't they been doing this for billions of years ? ''   `` Yes . ''   `` What happens if they get bored ? ''   `` Well I hope I 'm not around to see the day when they do . ''  
I chuckled as I looked at the place . Sure the walls looked impressive lighting up the night , but really it was just a joke to get past them . I went right past the guardhouse without so much as a strange look . The front door was a bit harder , doorman wearing the big old Red AB logo hat glared at me . He knew what was up , but still I was supposed to be there , so it was n't like he was going to get to say anything .   You would think they would pat me down or something . Make sure that I was n't armed , but it was all too easy .   `` You have it ? ''   `` Just say the word and you 'll have them . ''   `` Fine . I agree to the terms and conditions . ''   I smiled and handed the boy the game .   While he played I slapped a few things down onto the desktop . Went and put up a few toolbars , and left a few other little presents around the house . I smiled as I walked past the doorman , he was still glaring at me , but I handed him a notice .   `` Sorry Block , looks like you 've been fired again . Let Norton know he 's out of a job too when you get your things . ''   I smiled and walked back towards the gate , several dozen of my friends showing up to listen as I listed off some names of interesting people to visit .
*F**k ! This again . *   You see , a funny thing happened to me on my way to work this morning . Well I say funny but it actually is quite the opposite , a gust of wind caught me mid umbrella-unfolding and then next thing you know , I 'm in the middle of oncoming traffic and bam ! I 'm back in this cursed corridor , in my old awful high school next to the blasted water fountain .   Have you ever been caught sneaking around a high school ? During the school day ? The day I slipped in the shower found me on the register , and not the kind you 'd expect to find in a school .   And oh , look ! There is good old Mr. Jefferies and yup , he is calling the police . Oh and would you look at that it 's recess .   ^ ( Hi kids ! Do n't do drugs ! )   ... God I wish I did drugs .   Y'know , I hate that water fountain . I hate that Mr. Jefferies and I hate the fact I was on my way to work as a photographer .   *Yes you can confiscate the damn camera ! *   Well at least I know how I 'm getting out of prison .
The felt table reached as far as he could see in front , and stretched farther than he could see to his sides . Beside him on either side sat another being , and beside them more . Their eyes peeking down at the two cards tucked under their hands .   His turn was coming up , he knew this even though he did not understand . From his left he could hear another being calling `` check '' , and so next and the next , until the one next to him folded .   Silence seemed to loom , almost crushing as everyone , and he could feel all their eyes , their million eyes , on him . Shrinking he panicked ...   `` Your turn to talk ! '' grumbled the being to his right , `` look at your cards and make a call . ''   Two cards lay on the table , face down , their backs black and red a symbol he did n't recognize adorned them . Picking them up revealed a 10 of diamonds and a 7 of hearts .   `` Check ? '' the words whispered out of his mouth weakly .   `` Check ! '' the being next to him said , continuing a long line of checks and folds , occasionally he heard `` Raise '' followed by a collecting groan of a million voices .
`` Look , just trust me this one time . ''   `` Oh , this one time , sure . ''   `` Okay , along with all the other times . ''   `` The answer 's still no . ''   `` Fuckin ... why ? Do you doubt me ? ''   `` Every second of every day . ''   `` That 's rude . ''   `` It 's accurate , god ! ''   `` Well , you should still do it , god . ''   `` Give me a reason . ''   `` Trust me , I know it does n't seem like it , but the alternative is actually worse . ''   `` How ? ''   `` It 'd take too long to explain . ''   `` Last time you said that shit , you had me see to it that angry fucking German guy got rejected from art school , and look what that got us ! ? ''   `` Still not as bad as it could have been . ''   `` Wh-how ? How could it have possibly been worse ? ''   `` It 'd take- ''   `` Take too long to explain , yeah , sure . Fine ... I ca n't believe I 'm agreeing to this . '' And with a wave of his hand , they sat back and watched the next president of the United States sworn in , reiterating his promises to make America great again .
Bailey 's Office . Interior .   ___   The last thing I see is a flash of light . The pistol falls from my nerveless fingers and clatters to the tile floor . At least there is no pain .   I float , rising above it all . Rising up with the smoke , looking down at my crumpled body . Looking down at the fully engulfed room . The fire hungrily eating the papers .   I find myself wondering : why ?   What was so important that it led to this ? I know the answer to that , intellectually .   The audit . The inevitable discovery . But emotionally , the terror and the desperation is absent . The drive to protect others that has driven me all my life and that put my feet on this path is gone .   I ’ m still distantly pleased that my family will be taken care of , that the depositors will be covered , but the emotion is muffled and distant . At the most , it is mild .   Much like the gratitude that Billy had come to me right away . It used to be so intense . Now I can ’ t ... seem ... to remember why that was a good thing . It let me go to the sheriff . It let me make the deal .   Even that drifts away as I rise . I rise and rise .
Thanks ! Had n't noticed the chatroom somehow .   I actually just barely finished my novel on the 30th , so I 'm proud to say I wrote a book in 2015 .   Was it worth it ? I think so . I feel lot less self loathing when I see other people talking about their writing accomplishments .   But it 's a *lot* of work . I jokingly told my friend that if I knew it 'd be this hard at the start , I would n't have even gone into it .   To everyone writing a novel : You can do it . Even if you do n't write every day , as long as you honestly *believe* there 's an end in sight , then there is . It 's when you think you 're years away from being done that you never finish .   Edit : After reading the list /u/Lexilogical linked to , I just wanted to say everyone should read it . The best tip is to back up your stories . *Seriously* . Back up *everything* . Microsoft One Drive , Google Drive , Dropbox , Bitcasa , and Copy all offer free cloud storage . Every time I hit a milestone in my writing , I number the scrivener project folder and uploaded it to literally all of those services , and then I continue . Do n't find out how badly you need to do this the hard way folks .
I needed to be fast . No , more than needed- if I was too slow then that would be it . I lifted the lid and waves of stench blasted my face . I retched but I kept working . Heaving the foul contents out I heard a noise that made my heart stop . Panting . The bestial sound of an animal . The uncoiling of muscles and soft pad of predatory paws . Terror gripped me and I hauled faster . I just managed to pull it out when it burst into the room . We locked eyes and for an endless second I stared into that black monstrous oblivion . I turned on my heels and ran carrying my foul bulky load as delicately as I could . The membrane had been pierced in my haste and god knows how long that would hold . The beast was after me snorting and yipping , practically flying across the room . I fumbled with the door for seconds too long . Sharp teeth ripped and tore . It was over . I had failed .   “ Oh , for fucks sake Dog . Oh ew oh gross . BAD DOG. ” I shoved my disobedient pet into the garden and proceeded to clear up the bin mess that now scattered the floor .  
I burst through the cloud cover above the poor pilot below me . I told my wing-man to flank above the enemy and look for his partner . I maintained my speed as I saw my wing-man flash away to my right , I knew he was hunting the enemy before he told me on the radio . I dove towards the enemy and locked onto his plane , the enemy realized I had locked onto him and tried to shake away as my missile streaked towards him ... .   `` GARY ! Wake up ! ''   Gary awoke from his memory/dream thanks to his wife 's gentle insistence .   `` The family is here . Get up if you are n't dead . '' Gary 's wife like to remind him he was old .   He pretended to sleep as he watched his wife stomp out of the room with a rue smile . He got out of bed slowly as his bones cracked loudly to his own ears . Annoyed that he was awoken out of a dream from his past greatness he stomped downstairs after his wife .   Gary felt better than he had for a long time . The nag had woken him up at the best part of his dream , the part right before he shot down the enemy plane . He rarely had vivid dreams of his life experiences .   He hugged his son and daughter in law and asked them about work in passing . That was when he saw the cake sitting on the table with 7 candles . His heart clenched as he saw his granddaughter sprint towards him with a huge grin on her face .
The view from the window of the living room was mediocre at best . From the third floor flat , I could peer over the tenements across the way and in the distance see the city centre and the high rise flats to the north east . The leafy west end of the city was visible from my room at the back of the flat . The trees had been my only comfort for three days .   Of these three days , I had done very little . I had slept , I occasionally urinated , and drank from time to time . The rest of the time , I wanted to leave my bed but the cursing of myself for not leaving my bed sooner upset me and willed me to stay longer . If I turned to the left , I could see the trees . They were covered in golden leaves of autumn and fading to scarlets and dropping off .   For three days I had stayed in my room . A glass three days dirty had got me water from my bedroom sink . I rationalised that it would make me ill. No longer did I have the need to spend more time in bed .   So I sat munching on some toast feeling something . I had mustered up a lot of courage to enter the kitchen but I had done it . The sky greyed . My flatmate returned from work . He said his pleasantries and that was that .   `` What got you from your room today ? Hungry ? ''   `` No , '' said I . `` It 's just the rain ... '' and we looked to the window and it started to pour .
( I speak spanish but I 'm going to write it in English because . )   Dear twelve year old me .   I swear you are going to regret a lot of things in the future , but that 's ok.   You are gon na make a lot of mistakes and have A LOT of problems but the way you resolve them is gon na determine who you are .

Love , You .
I wanted to scream at him , but it 's challenging to yell at somebody who acts so young and so melancholy . It would be like kicking a newborn puppy . The earth could never survive after what he 'd done . Our ocean water was turned into lava and the food chain , among other things , would never be the same again .   `` You had a genie . You could have wished for fame , fortune , eternal life . Instead , you wished for the world 's oceans to be lava . Why ? ''   `` I realized what I wanted most was that feeling of being a kid again . Where the world is so exciting . Except I did n't want to trade in my current knowledge to go back to the innocence . Rather , I needed a game -a challenge . Did you ever play that game when you were younger on the playground ? Where the ground is lava ? ''   `` Yes , '' I said solemnly , realizing what happened .   `` It was supposed to be a fun game . I guess games are more fun when pretend than when real , huh ? ''  
Dad said I could play with his oil pastels when I could read the words on the box . I learned fast . I think I was happy before the divorce . After that , life was was mom and church and school where I was bullied . At 18 , I saw a painting at my actor-friend ’ s house of him and his boyfriend holding eachother , and I left the church forever .   My friends went to college . I worked at the mall and loved click-click-clicking across the polished floors with sunlight pouring through the skylights and canned music clearly audible in the mornings before the crowds arrived .   I met a boy . He kissed me by the lake . Getting old with him makes it hard to complain about anything else . Even the brain tumor .   When retail stopped being enough ( I wanted to be Ms. MyLastName and not Miss MyFirstName when I got old ) I became an elementary school teacher . Next month The Boy and I are moving in with his mother so she won ’ t have to go to a nursing home .   Every day , I remember words spoken to a skinny teenager who worked at the mall . “ Life goes on a lot longer than you think it will. ”   ***   200 exactly , according to Drive . Started at 286 , it was hard to pare down .   ( Edit , word choice )
reddit , the city of enlightenment , as they call it , how fucking precious . It may seem that way to those in the r/adviceanimals or r/askreddit boroughs , but to those of us in the boroughs of the damned , r/depression , r/confession , r/nosleep , or r/anxiety , it 's not exactly as pleasant . I live in the r/ depression borough , and here we have n't seen a clear sky for as long as anybody can remember . I used to always wake up to the sound of people falling from the towers , but then the city started bolting all of our windows shut . A wall seperates these boroughs from the rest of the city , and you ca n't get to the other side until you 've overcome whatever reason it is that you 're here . What kills me the most is knowing that r/gonewild is on the other side of that damn wall , and those bastards get to just sit there and jerk off while we 're all stuck here , barely alive , just trying to fight the urge to figure out how to pull those fucking bolts off of the windows so that we may end it all , and maybe , as I 'm falling , I 'll catch a glimpse of the other side of that wall . I suppose it 's not their fault I 'm here , and it 's not like I 'll never get there , but as much as hope can drive us , the last thing I need right now is another dead dream .
As Umbreon snuck in for a attack I were waiting in a nearby tree with a rifle , ready to shoot him . He had become a prick and deserved to die for what he had done . Almost killing pokemons and their trainers , that is enough to get your death sentance here in Kanto . I could n't resist taking the hit . This job did n't pay of as well as a pokemon trainer but it had to do . Ash made sure that I could no longer be a pokemon trainer . So this is my revenge .   Now here I was . Ready to take the shot . Umbreon would make his move and kill Pikachu right after I shot Ash . I took a deep breath . Aimed right at Ash . `` Goodbye my friend . '' I whispered and squeezed the trigger . The shot was fired and Ash fell to the ground . Umbreon was quick to react and Pikachu was no match for him . Both of them were lying on the ground , lifeless .   I took up my phone and dialed professor Oak . `` Yes , hello '' he answered on the other end . `` It is done '' I said with a cold tone . There was a brief moment of silence then Oak said . `` Good job Gary , I knew I could trust you . Get his pokedex and come home . ''
He has n't called . He promised and promised and promised , but what does that do in the end ? The joy that was brought by the promise was too easily destroyed by him not calling me . Now that I explain it , I feel pathetic . And even this is worse than him not being in my life or bailing out . At least before there were no risks , there were no unpredictable events , and best of all was that everything was planned out .   I knew that I would come home to an empty country house with two cats , one dog , and one bunny . I also knew that I would make my own meal , eat it , get changed , then head to bed . Next I would head back to my career in Washington D.C. after two hours of sleep . Yeah , that was my life .   Now I am twisting the phone cord , and it feels as if I am transported back to my teenage years . Life does n't look too good if that is true . `` History repeats itself . '' Ah , I hope not . Though it looks as if it is true . Because here I am twisting the phone cord waiting for a man to call me that promised he loved me and that he would call so I can hear if he is going to bail on me and it . No , not bailing on the pets .
`` Found another civilisation today , Bob '' . I looked up at my coworker , trying to force some expression of interest onto my face . Really , I did n't care . By the time you 've found an artefact of a new civilisation for the hundredth time , the novelty 's really worn off .   `` What do we have this time Jim ? '' I finally said .   `` Some sort of golden disc thingy . Here , have a look . '' Jim handed me what looked like an old vinyl record , with some strange diagrams carved on it .   `` Vinyl ? Really ? Looks like they have n't even become fully digitised yet . Toss it . '' Jim looked at me with a slight weariness as I handed it back to him .   `` You sure ? ''   `` Look we 've got our hands full with the Andromedans , Magellans , Scairans , and do n't even get me started on the Venusians . Last thing we need is some primitive civilisation added to the pile . It 's not work the effort . '' Jim moved to throw it into the trash . Suddenly I thought of what we are about to lose , a record of some strange , primitive , but maybe wondrous civilisation of other beings , and maybe our only way to contact them .   `` Wait ! '' I said . Jim looked up , confused . `` I 'd like to hang onto it after all , it 'll make a damn good coaster . ''  
`` What the hell is this ? '' I shouted , waving the ( not loaded ) Glock around angrily .   `` Uh , it 's your pistol , Chris . You know ... for your pistol duel ? The one you 've been scheduling for an entire year ? '' my lawyer said hesitantly .   `` NO ! NO ! This is unacceptable ! '' I ranted . `` How the hell is this an appropriate pistol for a pistol duel ? Have you ever seen a pistol duel ? Nobody uses a freaking modern pistol ! You use a flintlock pistol , or a six shooter , or some old timey gun ! Not this new age piece of crap ! ''   My lawyer ran his hand through his hair nervously . `` Well , you see ... the insurance companies were only willing to sign off on modern guns . They did n't like the idea of older guns . ''   That was the last straw . `` Are you kidding me ? You 've been working on the paperwork for an entire year , and you could n't get me any other pistol other than this ? ''   `` That would take ... three more years . ''   I fired him .   11/366
After installing the game , it requires me to log in with my Origin account . I oblige reluctantly , as that platform is n't very good .   & nbsp ;   The load times are excruciating , although that is par for the course for The Sims franchise . After 5 minutes of it , the main menu pops up . The new game option is not present , however there is a continue button . I click it and await for the game to load .   & nbsp ;   The save contains an already created family . A married couple , two kids and a cat . I can not edit them and assume I am playing a tutorial . I follow the game 's instructions and find it rather boring . Unsurprised at the sameness of the series , I decide to attempt to murder the unfortunate digital family .   & nbsp ;   I turn on the oven and leave it as such with the mother , and I send the father to the pool . After quickly removing the doors from the house and ladder from the swimming pool , I await .   & nbsp ;   After 5 minutes , the fire breaks out . It begins spreading through the house quite quickly . I wait expectantly as the characters panic and the flames approach .   & nbsp ;   Just as the flames approach one of the children , a message box appears . It reads simply :   & nbsp ;   `` Purchase the 'Death & Damnation DLC ' for US $ 6,99 to unlock cool features such as Sim death and murder ! ''   & nbsp ;   Damned EA .
`` What did I do ? I Fought with all I had ''   `` But , Did you kill them ? ''   `` Sure . You could say that their was never a dull moment you always had a weapon in your hand and a clear shot to shoot ''   `` But are they dead ? ''   `` Gone , Not dead . They where never alive in the first place ''   `` Daddy , Are you sad for them '' Jerking his head back to his dad   A tear wells up in his eye `` No only for the good men I lost . I think it is past your bed time . ''   `` Okay , Good Night ''   The child clambers upstairs as the mother walks into the room .   `` Are you okay ? ''   The husband crying in the chair   `` Whats wrong did he bring up some bad memories ? ''   `` No , No '' Says the husband trying to control himself `` He jerked his head just like Captain Bransok and Sargent Hiddle . ''   `` What does that mean ? ''   `` It mean the AI wars are not over . '' He says grabbing his laser rifle and heading upstairs .
One bullet , 9mm . He held it in his jacket pocket , his fingers holding the brass and copper in his fingers .   `` I drop it hard enough , it goes off and shoots the guy , '' he said . `` Not to kill , but probably enough to ruin his day . I learned how to do this on the range . Some guy taught me how to do this , taught me how to shoot without ever owning a gun . And I still keep it handy . ''   `` Why would you ever need to do that ? '' I said .   `` You ever lose something of someone else 's ? ''   `` No . ''   `` I did . Ten kilos of cocaine , from when I used to run drugs at the border in El Paso . I knew it was a setup . I just parked the car and walked away . I did n't intend to retire just yet . I went to the car wash and had a burger . When I came back someone else was jacking the car , and I made like it was n't my problem anymore . They think it still is , but there 's nothing I can do about it but practice and wait . ''
Bobo the clown was found dead . His mangled body was still clothed in the colorful fabrics from our performance the night before . Carla was the one who found him , stuffed haphazardly behind some hay bales near the camel paddock . The poor girl didn ’ t know what to do and ran straight to me . I was the ringleader in more than just job description , I kept our little band of oddballs together behind the scenes too . And now one of us was dead . As soon as I was sure Carla would be alright for a few minutes alone , I phoned the local police and made my way to the paddocks . It was a grisly scene . I didn ’ t want to look too closely at the body of my dead friend , but something in his hand flashed in the morning sunlight . I was alone , and the other performers were probably still waking up . No one would see me if I chose to investigate the object Bobo held in his cold fingers .   A : Investigate the object .   B : Wait until police arrive .  
`` It 's who we are , I suppose . Whether it be worth it in the end or not , '' the first said . Eyeing his alien cohort . Before the two , a column of smoke slowly dissipated as the sun began to rise , the human of the two striking a light . Shaking his lizard like head , the second found a seat in the dirt . `` We will make them pay . We will rebuild . Do you think Cortorol thinks that two of us exist ? '' The human turned away from the early dawn , striding toward the distant tree line , `` Does n't matter now does it . For all he knows his nemesis is dead . We can let him think that anyone is alive . And when the time comes we will retrieve our partner . '' As the dawn slowly encroached , the two onlookers disappeared into the receding shadow . Laying low until the culmination of events led them far away , where a distant star orbited by a lonely gas giant provided a safe haven for Cortorol , became a site of another tragedy .
`` Yo , my man Rick where you 've been ''   `` I got this new chick , and man , she 's all right ''   `` Shiit , you 've been with all kinds of chicks , even a mutant or two but I 've never seen you spend this much time with one ''   `` I 'm tellin you , she 's a very special girl , from her head down to her toe nails ''   `` So what ? You gon na marry this girl ? ''   `` Nah man '' Rick laughed `` this is n't the girl you take home to Mother , she 's a , ha , very kinky girl ''   `` Kinky ? like what ? ''   `` So get this , Last night , after our show ''   `` Ya ''   `` She 's waiting backstage in a limousine with all her girlfriends , and she says to me , 'Three 's not a crowd to me , room 714 , I 'll be waiting ' ''   `` menage a trois ? ''   `` Menaga a-mothafuckin-trois . I 'm telling you she had incense wine and candles like something you 'd read about in a New Wave magazine ''   `` What a freaky scene ! So tell me Rick , does she like the other boys in the band ? ''   `` She does , but I 'm her all time favorite ''   `` God damn , that girl is a super freak ''   `` She is supa FREAKY YOW ''     `` Temptations sing ''    
`` So ... can I go back now ? ''   `` Back ? ''   `` Yes . Back . Back home . ''   `` Oh no no no . That 's not how it works . ''   If Death could smile , he 'd be laughing . `` What do you mean ? '' I stand , knocking the table . Chess pieces turn to dust at my feet , Death 's king still lay shattered on the table in front of me .   `` You have walked through my door , now shut and locked behind you . No one is allowed back unless under specific orders . Your body has already been cremated and soul forgotten . ''   `` Then what was the point of the game ? Is there truly no honour in death ? ''   Death swirls in the darkness , his voices crackling in the shadows . `` That is for you to decide . ''   `` What ? ''   `` I retire at last . Oblivion awaits me . Choose wisely , and heed not the prayers of desperate men . ''   I say nothing but my thoughts echo in the empty space . `` What do you mean ? ''   `` Ave Atque Vale , Thanos . You have become death . ''
My life ended , but it was n't the shambling moaning hell I thought it would be . It certainly was terrifying and painful . I was pulled from my wrecked car and the zombies clawed and bit me . But rather than devour me like I had seen in the movies , it was if they had lost interest . They got up and walked away . One of them even waved and said `` Bye '' .   I started laughing , it was just too absurd ! Then what I thought were delusions set in almost immediately .   Suddenly the world was not in flaming ruins .   Suddenly the zombies were gone and many people were wandering around looking confused .   I found a cheerleader sitting on a park bench and asked what had happened .   `` Evolution , '' was all she said and returned to staring blankly at the peaceful lake .   I was sure if I concentrated long enough that the hallucination would fade and I could see all the zombies and burning buildings . I must have stood there for hours staring at the distant towers . When the sun finally set I shook my head and scratched at my long curly red hair and wandered off .   I needed to go home and get out of this dress , it was torn and splattered with blood . I was hungry , but I was n't sure what for . I grew up with stories and movies about zombies loving brains , but I was n't sure that 's what I wanted ... a nice , juicy , raw steak suddenly sounded appealing though . I decided to stop at the grocery store on my way home and see what they had .
As I lay upon my final moments I felt ice creep into my veins . I never heard it coming . I 'd never heard anything at all . But the Grim Reaper brought a surge of life to my unborn ears in death , the birth of a soundtrack for a day . The sounds of blankets against my skin were loud and mesmerizing . Intensity accompanied all of the vibrations within my vicinity and I shivered . The recital was today , my brother 's time to shine in front of his peers and spectators alike . I remember my mom 's hands signing the air with such importance , repeatedly , to let me know how proud she was but today she just said it and I could understand by her tone of voice ; there were no hands . Then the time shifted through the everyday rhythms , all captivating in their simple expectancy , until I was facing the curtained stage . When the audience went silent I felt an uneasy familiarity and held my breath to hear my own heartbeat until the performance began . The melody flowed seamlessly into me and I experienced music in its entirety . It was beautiful . My brother 's contribution to such a personal sensation was inspiring , a heart within a symphony . As the lights came on and the curtain began to close I sank deep into my seat , rhythms rushing around my head . I closed my eyes and it all began to muffle , but my foot tapped into eternity , a deafening back beat finale .

The universe was collapsing in on itself , swallowing all that man had once nurtured and loved and explored . As the walls came crashing down and the void beyond it all came flooding in , a man at the center of it all sat serenely before a rift in space .   He need n't wear a suit or reside in a ship . Humanity had long ago conquered the obstacle that was mortality .   The man floated , staring into the shimmering hole . Time was of the essence , as it was being devoured by the universe 's demise . Beyond that rift lay a brave new world , one that all other humans had poured into before the apocalypse . This lone man had wanted to stay , though . He had wanted to see space and time itself rip apart , to watch the coils of galaxies unwind , to observe the undoing of the greatest of man 's enemies : Time .   He sighed . There had been some that ended themselves , worried that this new universe before him would not be enough to house what man had become . He had smiled away their concerns .   As the end of all things crashed around him , he bellowed ,   `` Never tell me the odds ! ''   And he floated through the portal .
JSS : `` Dad , I 'm not letting you back into heaven. ``   JHVH : `` You shall feel my wrath ! ''   JSS : `` I 'm sure . But I will turn the other cheek .

Why do n't you come down to hell and help me roast some sinners and drink Mai Tais ? ''   JHVH : `` Might as well . ''
I ’ ve received wonderful things in my life – beauty , charm , music . I ’ ve been granted talent and knowledge , I ’ ve been heralded as the first of my kind . I ’ ve been given desirable traits , and even some less desirable ones . Though why anyone would deem curiosity and persuasion as unfortunate has clearly never been curious or persuasive . I am lucky and confident enough to be able to give back what I have received tenfold . And I do , on a daily basis .   But on this day , I do not feel confident or lucky . Despite my persuasive charms , I was given the most amazing and most miserable gift in my entire life . I know what my role is and I have accepted it , cherished it , even . I have excelled at what I am . So why , then , am I punished so ? Why am I still being tested ?   “ Do not open it , my dear . You will not want to see what is inside . For once , this is a gift I wish you not to share . It is a **responsibility** . You are now the keeper , the guardian . I entrust you with this. ”   “ Zeus , I can not . You know I can not . I do not have…the willpower. ”   “ Pandora , have faith . The fate of the world rests in your hands now . I have struggled too long to keep the evils inside at bay . I pass it along to you now . ”   He had not even left my sight before my curiosity got the better of me .  
`` Keep your lid twapped , and your twap shut , daddy-o . No twouble . ''   `` What ? '' I tried to say , but `` Whhggh '' came out instead .   Meghan leaned over from the passenger seat of my used Cadillac and took the rag out of my mouth . `` I do n't want to see no fighting , you hear ? We aint 's got 's to do this with no twouble . It 's a clean kick . You get me in , you get me out . No twouble . ''   `` Why are you talking like that ? Where does a ten-year old even get a pin-striped suit ? ''   She pistol whipped me with a silver revolver . `` No questions . ''   I tried to grab at her , only to realize my hands were cuffed to the steering wheel .   `` Get a move on it , Daddy-o . The bank opens in ten minutes . ''   `` I ca n't even drive like this ! '' I yelled . `` The car 's a manual . ''   She pistol-whipped me again , and then unlocked the cuff to my right hand , still pointing the barrel of her gun at me . `` Best not give me no twouble , '' she said , glaring at me beneath her fedora .   It was n't until she dumped me off the side of the freeway , with $ 500 in each of my pockets , that I realized the `` Capone '' novelty plates on my car may have had something to do with her behavior .
A free bird ca n't be caged , that 's what they say . And how could I try , with her spirit so wild and her heart so free ? I was not like that though . Mine belonged to her solely .   So there I was in the chapel , in full uniform - not the uniform I was used to , but a uniform nonetheless - today I traded my fatigues for a tuxedo . I must have been the best dressed man in the room , save for the groom . Even though we saw the same barber , his freshly cropped hair even looked straighter and cleaner than mine .   I know it 's traditional for the best man to stand , but it would be another few months , or maybe more , of physical therapy before I could do so of my own strength again , if ever . But I could not abandon my post , so there I sat , in the shadow of the groom , ring in my breast pocket , dressed to the nines .   All went pretty much as expected . I handed the ring over , and I watched her willingly and with joy take the golden and diamond-bejeweled shackle onto her finger . A free bird ca n't be caged , huh . Well , so much for that . I answered the call , and I did my duty . It was the hardest service I had ever performed .   After the tedious pageantry drew to a close , a simple salute served to part ways with the groom . Semper fi , brother .
`` Please do n't go.. ''   That is what I wished I would have said . Instead I just watched her walk away , like a stone statue showing no emotion , saying nothing back . If I were here I would have left to . But now my world is falling apart , there is a void in my heart that she used to fill . Food doesn ’ t taste as good , I can ’ t sleep . I wish I would have said something then , I wish I could say something now . But no , I am lost in the void of my own pity .   There was something about the way she smelled , something so chemical about my attraction to her . I hung on her every word , she meant everything . And I couldn ’ t keep her . If I could see her know I would tell her she was my sun and my moon . That I could see her smile in every star in the night sky . I would tell her that I would be better , I would try harder . But I can ’ t say anything now . My mouth froze at the last moment we had together .   `` Please do n't go.. ''
*Please bear in mind that this is my first attempt . So please have mercy on me and any help , advice or feedback is welcomed and encouraged . *   You turn to face Death , a small hermaphrodite figure with the face of everyone you 've ever loved . They smile and you feel all at once safe and very , very afraid .   They speak and Death 's voice echoes the same sentiment as their face ; a curious blend of the voices of everyone you 've ever loved . `` Pick a game , any game , and if you are the victor , I 'll send you back to the day before the accident . '' says Death .   Among the myriad of faces flashing before you one clings to your memory . Your late Grandmother 's face , a clever woman , a sharp woman . Her face held her patented knowing look and mocking smile .   The fear leaves you , quickly replaced by courage . You know what to do .   `` Any game ? '' You ask . Death nods their head . Grandma 's face flashes at you again , an all-knowing smile spread wide .   You pluck up your courage `` I choose life '' .  
*The trouble with becoming a writer* he began , *is that there is never enough time to write out the entire story . *     His nose crinkled at the sentence he had just written in sharpie , cursive with a swill and swagger to the s 's . This was trying *way* too hard .     *Inquisitor Arensus , large in stature , pure of heart , broad chest and a mind of magic , -*     He scrapped the paper and threw it behind him . It fell the floor with a unsatisfying *clack* that was n't crispy enough .     *The Mortimer twins , and Doctor Martyn-*     `` Who would spell their name , something so common as *Martin* with a y ? What is this , second grade ? ! '' He scrapped another piece of paper . It was hard enough to start the story , it was harder to appreciate the crap you were trying to get down on paper .     For weeks , years probably , he had built up a world of intrigue , politics and magic , something that resembled Django Wexler 's musket magic series , something that would match the length of Steven Erikson , something that would inspire awe over the ages like Frank Herbert ! He wanted to write it all down , in an exciting tale of friendship , loss , betrayal , everything !     But the closest thing he could come up with that was anything near decent was :     *Magic man beats out even Mordecai with the help of twins that are magically connected and seem to get it on with their maid . *     His nose crinkled again , as he scrapped the paper .
`` How long do you think it 'll take them to finish ? ''   `` Calm down Rick they 'll be done in a couple minutes , then you got ta clean the mess up . ''   `` What do you mean mess ? ''   `` What you thought there would n't be a mess after a man gets beat to death ? ''   `` ... ''   `` It 's fine , the Angels pay generously and they usually do n't make that bad of a mess . ''   `` What did the guy even do ? ''   `` Who cares . He did something the Angels did n't like so he 's paying for it . ''   `` How is Nicky ok with this ? ''   `` Like I said they pay good , plus it 's good to be on their good side . ''   `` I do n't have a good feeling about this . ''   `` You know what , here . ''   `` Why are you giving me this ? ''   `` Just in case . You seem scared and a gun will help ease your worries . ''   `` What the fuck Mary ? I 've never even touched a gun . ''   `` Take classes . It 's good to know how to defend yourself especially in these times . ''   `` Jesus Christ ... ''   `` ... ''   `` ... ''   `` Ok smoke breaks done . The screamings over . ''  
The power had gone out with a click . The whirring of the running refrigerator slowed to a stop . The apartment was nearly black aside from the faint glow of moon light that peered in from behind the living room blinds . Henry approached them and separated two with his fingers to get a look out from his second story unit .   Below , nothing stirred . The lamps that lit the paths between the buildings were off so that he had never seen his complex darker . In the building across from his , he could see some blinds moving as he guessed others , too , were trying to gauge the danger .   He was glad not to be living in a city ; the news had shown the rioting in Baltimore . Shadowed figures throwing bricks in front of burning cars and knocked-out windows . From the images he had seen , the whole city appeared to be on fire .   He imagined it was probably quite noisy .   But here in the suburbs , even the pillars of smoke rising from the city were invisible . Occasionally , a car horn would blare or an alarm would go off , but it would n't last .   None of it would .   Henry sat down on his black leather couch and stared across the treated hardwood floor at a blank TV screen . If it was all going to end , Henry decided , he 'd rather end doing the thing he always felt most comfortable doing .   With his eyes locked on the black TV screen , he imagined all the shows he 'd watched . He waited for the end .   It came .   ___________________   EDIT : Typos galore .

`` Now turn your books to page 21 , we are going to learn about internet culture today ! ''   Mr Peer was always an outcast back in his youth . The memes , they were to blame . That frog , those awful prequels from the classic movie series , spanning five trilogies and seven TV series , Star Wars , which involved many random , poorly-acted quotes . He always blabbered on about this , and today he was extra excited , as today we were learning about it , and somehow they have become important aspects of history .   Anyway , I digress ... So , we turn to page 21 to see ... Whaddaya know , a new title ... Spelled out in crimson red , wrote the obnoxious comic sans title of : `` Internet and meme culture of the 2010 's '' . I 'll give you an extract from the best one I 've found .   `` Prequel memes '' are trends which were vital for preserving the culture of the 2010s . The prequels of the Star Wars trilogies were , at the time , very humorous . Image two shows actor Ian McDiarmid portraying the character of Chancellor Palpatine , which he was known as `` The Senate '' ...  
Fuck that guy 's fat . I mean seriously fat . Like fall over and you ca n't get up for a couple of hours fat . I snort as he walks past my table . He looks at me with puppy eyes as I smirk . Like a fat puppy . God he needs to sort himself out . I chuckle to myself .   This is my favourite spot . Right next to the front door in Starbucks , so that I can see everyone coming in , and get free re-fills for my tea . I 'm now on my fourth cup , so it 's more like flavoured hot water , but whatever . It 's free . So 's the Internet ; that 's my reward for being around so many worthless plebs .   A plastic woman walks in carrying a tiny rat-like dog in her handbag . I hope it shits in there . I bet she looks down on me for not being as rich as her . I mutter `` ugly Barbie '' as she walks by , just loud enough for her to hear but not to be certain that it was me who said it . Confused , she swivels and looks around her ; I put on an innocent smile .   That 's it for today , so I grab my books , making sure to knock the remnants of my tea onto the table and that they drip onto the floor , to make sure that these spotty teenagers earn their pay , and wander out of the cafe .
`` Welcome , sir . So , it 's your twenty-first ? '' The clerk asked , while putting files away with her mind .   `` Yup . I 'm super excited . What are some of the most popular ? '' Mark was bursting with joy . Soon , he 'd be a regular ol ' Superman^ ( TM ) .   `` Well , there 's the ever-popular flight , teleportation , telekenesis , and shape-shifting . Of course , you can always browse the catalogue for some other , lesser known powers . Just head over to the computer and enter your name . ''   Mark nodded , and left the desk . Inhaling deeply , he sat , and typed his name .   HAPPY 21st BIRTHDAY , MARK . PLEASE SELECT YOUR POWER .   The sheer amount of powers fueled Mark 's excitement . He thought , and he thought , and he thought . He racked his brain for the right idea . So many options , so little time ...   Finally , one caught his eye . The final power in the list , the greatest one . *By the nine* , he thought , *This is greatest power ever . Surely this must be the most popular ? *   POWER # 904 . 0 USERS .   *None ? That ... that makes no sense ! I do n't ... I ... but ... *   It did n't matter , though . It was his . This power would make him the happiest man on Earth .   YOU HAVE SELECTED POWER 904 , EXTREME OPTIMISM . ENJOY .
I walked through the crowded streets of Moscow , waiting for that fateful march . A Priest walked through the streets , ringing a bell and calling out to repent your sins . Gunshots resonated throughout the streets . I missed it ! I cursed and threw my lump of hard stale bread at the ground . I was so sick of bread . A young boy covered in soot yelled at me .   > You 're throwing away your bread ? Are you crazy ?   I punched him in the face .   > I hate your bread ! I hate your Czar ! I hate the Russian Empire !   Another man approached me who had a red star pinned to his jacket . He had a full mustache and head of hair .   > Standing up to the evil imperialists , eh ? The people could use a man like you .   I shook his hand . Now things were getting interesting . I shook his hand .   > Nice to meet you ... Comrade .   > Nice to meet you as well , allow me to introduce myself . My name is Josef , Josef Stalin .   I froze . I took out my gun and pointed at him . No ! You 'll rewrite history ! If you do , you 'll fail the class ! We wo n't be able to bring you back ! I fired , then faded from from existence . Whoops .   Not that good yet  
I had played this fantasy over in my mind for years . After the ceremony , when she would vow to love my friend for all her life , I would have a chance to dance with her just once during the reception . It would be a slow song . I would hold her close to me one last time and imagine those vows she just said were for me . My fingers pressed into the fabric of her perfect dress , forever woven on my palms , the pads of my fingers reaching , stretching beyond the layer of her dress to her skin that bore no blemish .   At the right moment I would lean and whisper to her that I was sorry for all the stupid things I said when I was young . We could have done it , you know ? We could have made it work . We could have been together and sanctified .   Instead , she danced with him . They stayed for only a moment , then ran to the getaway car under the rain of birdseed . The vehicle turned the corner , and slid away into perfect hindsight .   I loosened my tie and went home .
The sound of a piercing alarm broke the heavy silence and the lights dimmed again . The lighted billboard on the wall indicated that only 15 days remained until they would be shut off completely . Entire families had already said there final goodbyes and then gone to bed peacefully for the last time . In fact , I was pleasantly surprised by the efficiency of the whole operation . There were no mass riots and very little violence in general - everyone knew that this was coming and there was nothing we could do to save our home now .   The ones who were lucky enough to leave had been selected years ago . Though , I 'm not quite sure if lucky is the right word to use . Being sent out into the cold vastness of outer space on a course that was only based on weak signals from far away systems did not seem that fortunate to me . They had asked me , of course , but I had refused . As silly as it seems , this was my home . I was born here and it only felt natural that I should die here . I took one final look around me and saw them all laying peacefully in their pods - unconcerned about the horrors that still lay ahead . My pod was the only one that remained opened now .   Slowly , I got up and proceeded towards the door . There was still one last thing I had to do .
The first to open the door . Perhaps it should be called curiosity , but I have never been that curious . The door called to me , like an ocean siren , giving a sweet lullaby to lure me in its trap . I was unaware of what was on the other side .   The rusted door made of heavy iron slowly crept open , letting the light from the room behind fill it . There was a single jewel adorning a pedestal . The door swung close with a loud and abrupt thud .   `` You chose . '' A voice , all around , inside my head , in the air , whispered softly to me . `` You felt the call . It is quite rare for a Human to feel it . '' My heart felt in agony as it began to beat against the walls of my chest . I fell to the ground , soaked in sweat . Was it sweat ? No , it was blood .   `` So , what is your wish ? What do you desire ? '' I looked at the pedestal . I understood . I crept forward , every inch closer feeling like a millennium . Every muscle movement a decade . I touched the jewel after the end of time , and smiled . I was God .
My grandmother was.. Strange , to say the least . Sure , everyone has their odd bits , but how many people lock their attic so tight it 's like the arc of the covenant ? Sure , she baked the best cookies , and was so sweet ... Except , for that damn attic . If you went near it , or dared try to open it , that sweet old woman is gone , replaced by a vicious harpy . Still , it 's not right to wonder so badly about a dead woman 's secrets . I 'm sure it was nothing , perfectly normal ... But it called so loudly . After all ... This was now *MY* house . She would have taken care of it ... Right ? So as I picked , broke , and hacked off the locks , I felt scared ... Yet a yearning overpowered it . I wanted it . Opening the musty door , I saw what must have been hundreds of floating orbs . A note floated down , reading `` to whomever finds this note . Chances are you are my child , curious on what 's in the room , even though the family has kept it for so long . What this room is the last refuges of an elder time , a war . Wether fighting for the home world or earth , in time , all died . This room holds their tales . Love , charolette , 1678 . '' As I read , I backed up ... And caused a bauble to drop , and a candy colored tall woman walked out . `` Greetings , my names bismuth ''   Yes it 's stupid steven universe AU .
The street was bustling with the near rush hour crowd tying to beat five o'clock . He shoved his way through the crowded sidewalk trying to keep up with the girl of his dreams . He could see her half a block ahead . The summer sun and wind seemed to find her , seemed to accentuate her sun dress . As she paused at the crosswalk he saw his curse floating above her head . He desperately tried to reach her before the taxi she did n't see struck and killed her . He did n't reach her in time , he never did . He sat on the curb with tears streaming down his face and looked at the people crowding the street , looking for the sign of death above their heads . It was her destiny , he told himself .   Later that night as he was dying of an overdose he had a moment of clarity , he saw the sign of death and knew that he would die . It was his curse , he often saw the sign of death for people and no matter what he did could never stop it from coming true . He did n't even bother trying to call 911 , it was too late . The sign confirmed it .  
“ I think we go to heaven. ”   “ Thank you Jimmy , please sit down. ”   “ I think we go to dirt. ”   “ Thank you Caroline , please sit down. ”     “ I don ’ t think we go anywhere at all. ”   “ Thank you Thomas , please sit down. ”   “ I think we become skeletons and then we do that. ”   “ Thank you Peter , please sit down. ”   “ I think we go to sleep and wake up somewhere else. ”   “ Thank you Tina , please sit down. ”   “ I think we feel really good. ”   “ Thank you Daniel , please sit down. ”   “ I don ’ t know. ”   “ Thank you Gregory , please sit down. ”   “ I think we do it all over again. ”   “ Thank you Kara , please sit down. ”   “ I think our moms will miss us very much. ”   “ Thank you Tony , please sit down. ”   “ I think we become angels. ”     “ Thank you Barry , please sit down. ”   “ I think we dream. ”   “ Thank you Abdul , please sit down. ”   “ I think we sit down. ”   “ Thank you Rebecca , please sit down. ”     edit : Thank you ? ? ? for the gold , please sit down .
Okay ... so , the first day or two , I thought I was having some kind of dream . So , I 'm really sorry about the Tomb of the Terra Cotta Bunnies . That was supposed to belong to some guy called Qin Shi Thingummy , or something . Really , I ca n't overstate how sorry I am about the bunnies . In my defense , the guy was a douche .   Secondly ... the , uh , Incas ? Not supposed to have zeppelins . Or cyber-llamas . You know , I 'm not really sorry about that , you people were dicks in my timeline . Plus , the Castilian coat of arms looks bitchin ' with those rayguns and llamas rampant on it .   Um ... Okay , what else , what else ? Ooh , the Sistine Chapel ! Donatello and Leonardo were n't supposed to be anywhere near there , but ... well , there was this show , see , when I was a kid , with these ... these talking ... look , it seemed really funny when I was drunk , okay ?   Yes , I pantsed the Dadaist with the little mustache . And it was *so* worth it .
My hand trembled as my pen hovered above the accounting book . The Devil had told me I could write any name in the left column and that person would come back to life . However , accounts always had to balance and The Devil uses weighted scales . For every name I wrote on the left , ten thousand people I did not know would die on the right . Was it worth it ?   I put the pen down . I could n't do it . I was n't a murderer . I could n't do it . I looked at the clock . Five minutes to midnight . The Devil had said all accounts would close at midnight tonight and all transactions were final .   I thought of Lily . I remembered her warm smile ; her sweet voice ; her bright eyes , full of life .   I looked back at the clock . Two minutes to midnight . I picked up the pen and wrote Lily 's name in the left column . I closed the book . I felt happy and sick at the same time . I lay down on the bed and watched the clock . Tick ! Tick ! Tick !   Finally , the clock struck midnight and the room was engulfed in a blinding flash of light . My eyes finally adjusted and then I saw her . Lily had returned to me . I rushed towards her with open arms , but suddenly I realized something . My heart had stopped . I fell forward , crashing to the floor .   `` Peter ! Peter ! '' Lily cried as my eyes began to close forever .   I guess I was not the only one with a book .
I saw her , smoking in the yard by herself , every morning . She would always be smiling , laughing , or walking along with other people . The people she was walking with had bruises , casts , or scars.i felt outcasted because she could n't see what was wrong with me . So I started smoking , but only in the morning .   She started the first conversation . She said , `` Hey ! How 's it going ? ''   The first thing I said to her was a lie ! This beautiful woman standing in front of me asked how I was doing . Here of all places . The only thing that came out of my mouth was fine .   I did n't lie to her once . I lied to her days , months , but , not a year .   One days she asked me the question I always was hoping to hear .   `` Do you.want to . Run . Away . ''   My chest sank , a tingling sensation bum rushed my arms and legs . I could n't find the right words . I said what I still regret to this day .   `` Work here I ca n't ''   I 'm . Sorry I 'm drunk  
At midday , the King signed me off with his sword and the waive of his wrist . My death rite , the last honor , to hold the same steel that I had betrayed my brethren with . They frowned down at me with scorn . Years of service forgotten . For a memory , of a memory , of a newcomer 's whisper held more weight than my sword itself .   These calloused hands would never grip a friend 's again . These feet , never to ache under the march of heavy mail . My hair never to feel the closure of a helmet . My tongue the taste of beer it would mourn . Nor my spirit the raging passion of a battle cry .   I turned the blade toward me , suddenly steel I knew so well felt so cold in my hands . We enter from a warm womb into an icy world . Why had I expected going out to be any different ?   Piercing my intestines , I felt blood ooze out onto my innocent hands . A soft whimper escaped my lips , adding more distaste to the scorn of the onlookers . It 's one thing to be a false criminal , and another to suffer your King 's judging eyes . I would rather be gone , than live with either .   I hacked fresh dots of red into the snow . Letting my memories flash by . But as the world slowly slipped away , the wails of a widow guided me , into deaths permanent embrace .  
It is almost done . My life 's work the time machine is almost complete . I 'm a mere hour away from the first test and I 'm sweating buckets .   Twelve o'clock on the dot I take one last look at my completely ordered lab and step into the machine . The hatch closes and I start it up , it 's working ! But as it starts the ground shakes and ruins the perfect order of my lab , no this ca n't be ! Spanners , wrenches , soldering irons . Tools everywhere I must clean this up I must have order ! But the hatch it 's stuck !   Suddenly a bright light . Another time machine appears and out of it steps ... me ? I nod at myself and start cleaning up the mess that my once beautiful lab has now become . I know what I must do . I can trust myself to order the chaos . I punch in the exact time I saw the light and I am gone .   I try the hatch again , aha ! Success ! It works . I see myself trapped I nod and begin the arduous task of cleaning up .
The winds blow against the shores of the sea , making waves that push and pull in the afternoon breeze .   There were times happier than this , from before . Still , just coming , back , seeing it all again ...   He takes in a deep breath and pulls out a cigarette . The lighter flicks out a small flame , and he breathes out smoke , just like the buildings on the other shore .   *Ten years . *   Last time , the water was n't filled with trash and bodies .   *Well , * another puff , *last time , I was in love . *   The waves roll on , on and on and on . No seagulls break their shifting song , no sunlight sparkles off their glistening backs .   *Love , * he decided , *Love is like this . Waves and waves at first , but that 's all perspective . They 're really just ripples . Ripples in a pond . And sometimes , *   Another draw . *those ripples fade to nothing . *   *But that 's not what happened , * He remembers . *It ended with a bang , like those buildings . A bang . Then nothing , nothing but the emptiness of smoke , the ghosts that never leave . *   He flicks the cigarette away , and the flame sizzles when it meets the waves .   *But that 's all I have now . *   A long seagull screeches above , and he smiles .   *Smoke . Smoke , and the ghosts of yesterday . *  
I look down at the broken piece of bark before me .   Laws of the land   1 . Capital crimes will be punished by death or exile   2 . Stealing will be punished by 10 lashes per object stolen   3 . All citizens will be subject to a mandatory draft   4 . All citizens are required to work   5 . All decisions will be through a council elected with one person per 100 every 3 years   This sounds good , it should cover just about everything and is nice and tidy . Its fair through the election of government and self sustaining by taxing the citizens . It should make a fine foundation , if only I could carve it in stone , and have somebody listen to it .   I look around at my surroundings , corpses litter the ground and the food stores are burning giving off the smell of burnt grain . In the other direction the sickly sweet smell of burning flesh is coming from what was our living quarters .   If only we 'd had this sooner , if only we 'd better protected ourselves .   If only we had n't split up over a single bushel of grain .
Bill was driving when phone rang , he picked it and was provided scandalous revelations courtesy of the Commander-in-Chief , aka his wife . Man , she was *bitch* .   But Bill smiled .   `` Atta girl ! ''   The infamous smirk was gone from the President 's face on the other end of the line .   `` Who was he ? We should get drinks ! '' came Bill , as if looking for someone to high five .   Hillary 's bewilderment provided no response .   `` Wait . Do n't tell me . Was it a *she* ? ! '' Bill said , almost hopefully .   `` No ... Bill ... what ? ''   `` Hillary , Lord knows I have n't been there for ya these last few years I mean , there was that time at the inauguration with the eagle and the Secret Serv- ''   `` Bill ! ''   `` You 're not giving me alot of help her- ''   `` Fuck it ! Nevermind ! ''   `` Whadya mean nevermi- ''   *click*   `` Should I stop ? '' came a voice from Bill 's lap . He was n't alone in the car .   `` Nonono you 're good . '' Bill replied as he struggled to open the dashboard and grab the cigar he 'd kept ready for such an occasion . He 'd totally called it .
I do n't have a long life . I 'm fine with it . What choice do I have anyways ? I 'm a candle and I 'm made to die fast . But it angers me if a human dies fast . I love humans ! They 're always happy around me ! But the day I died I just could n't take the screams as anything happy . I was being lit up at a dinner in the apartment of a nice family . The mother , her husband , her 2 little twin daughters and her son . I loved the two girls . They were fascinated by me and the special light I gave . When they finished the food and took all the things back into the kitchen one of the little girls accidentally hit the fathers wine glass and it splashed all over me ! My flame went out but it kept on on the tables blanket . It quickly lit up completely . The children were shocked and started screeching so loud ! Their mother ran into the room and was shocked but did n't know what to do . The table started burning aswell and now the husband made it into the room . The shelf fell over and landed in front of the door when the son ran into it because a huge flameburst came out of the table . Everyone looked at the father tried to lift the shelf but it catched fire and he had no where to grip . I then quickly burned down and luckily did n't have to witness the horror my little flame caused .
It 's been almost 3 years now . I never understood why they left . I 've been thinking about them , a lot . Almost every day . It has been really tough since then . The world is just darker . I can feel it .   They said they 'll be there when we need them . But I 've been calling for them everyday . I never got a response . I guess they 're not coming back . I guess ... they lied .   My brother does n't really understand . He 's too young . I do n't even know if he remembers them , he was only 2 years old when they left . But I do . They used to be around , they helped a lot . The world seemed to be a better place with them . It never got this dark , there was always someone caring for us . There was always hope .   Of course they were n't perfect . But they were our heroes . Some days they just made it worse , but in the end , we needed them and we loved them .   It 's been really hard for me without them . Going through puberty , struggling with depression and bullies ... Stupid nursery school . Suicidal thoughts , mental breakdowns ... Ugh ...   I did n't have anyone to count on . And yet I had to be brave and strong for my brother . He 's busy growing up , making friends and he might not notice , but he sometimes feels their absence too .   I miss them , Yeah I really miss my parents .
`` Well , this came out wrong . Gon na have to redo the whole story again . Much more tedious than you might think . '' He said to Abraham .   `` True . Shall I gather two of every kind again just like last time ? '' Abraham asked .   `` Yes , just like last time . ''   *24 HOURS LATER*   `` Get ready Abraham ! I 'm about to redo history ! '' God echoed .   `` I feel kinda sad for everyone else though . They wo n't be able to see the world again . '' Abraham thought .   `` Yes , but the story will be better than ever ! '' God chanted .   `` OPEN THE FLOOD GATES '' God commanded .   Just as he finished the sentence a great flood rushed throughout the lands and wiped the face of the earth . Everything was plain and reset .   `` I have great ideas for this version ! '' God smiled .   `` Wait , where 's Sarah ? '' Abraham said .   -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- -- --   Sorry if this was bad . I was pretty bored .
`` Take my picture , Ron . '' She said holding a pancake at a dive in Iowa , just like she had in front of the grand canyon , with the dancers in Las Vagas , at LAX , and with every meal she had eaten in between . Snap .   `` Now a picture of yourself . '' I turned the phone around and took a selfie with my breakfast , just as I had done at the golden gate bridge , the coast of Oregon , Yellowstone National Park , and every other stop that my mother and I had made . I noticed over the past few weeks that a haze had began to claim more and more of her memory , but every fight she had inside of her was arm wrestling Alzheimers .   We drove three hours back to our hometown , listening to oldies on the radio and getting all the lyrics wrong . I did n't want to think about what would happen when this disease had taken every bit of her away from me , leaving only her body . Although , I could n't help it . I dropped her off at home , kissing her and giving her the camera filled with our adventure .   Two weeks later , I knocked on her door . A call from her nurse about her rapid declination terrified me . When I saw her , she looked at me quizzically . `` Hi , do you know who I am ? '' I asked trying not to cry .   `` Of corse . '' She smiled , `` Your the man from the photographs . '' She motioned to a wall full of selfies I had taken on our vacation .  
It 's 11:10 . The moment of truth will come at 11:11 . I like 11:11 . At my old middle school , 11:11 was when me and the whole class would sing , `` 11:11 , make a wish ! '' Now I 'm in high school , where such jubilation would n't have involved me . I hate the people who surround me . There are jocks , nerds , bullies , blondes . I hate all of them for different reasons . It 's complicated , I wrote a manifesto about it : 20 pages long , single spaced , 12 point font . You can read it at my funeral . For I am about to open fire on this class . I have a machine gun hidden in my lacrosse bag . Ah ! It 's 11:11 . Time to . . .   Holy shit ! Frank ! What the fuck ! Now I 'm crouched under a desk . A fellow classmate , Frank , had the same idea as me , and he just opened fire on the class . I 'm dead I 'm dead I 'm dead . Haha he believed that I was dead . He left the room . Okay , now I 'm army crawling to my lacrosse bag , getting the gun out . Today , I wo n't be a murderer - I 'll be a hero .
Holy Fuck . My brain just exploded ( Metaphorically ... not how I was going to die , but I can understand your confusion ) .   The images played out infront of me , toothpaste mixed with saliva dripping from my mouth as I witnessed my death . My insane , awesome death ( at least to me it was ) .   Saddled on a three-legged monster , a crown atop my head , aviators over my eyes , and an army behind me . I was giving them a speech , to defend their country , to protect their children , to save their future . A victorious uproar spread throughout the ranks . I turn around to face my enemy : 28 gigantic beasts , controlled by hundreds surrounding their feet . I pick up my tri-blade laser chainsaw and shout for the attack .   Then the planet explodes .   The toothbrush falls to the floor , staining my brand new bathroom rug ( I just bought it yesterday , plus it was quite cheap ) . I had to prepare , the end was coming ( ALSO SPACE/FUTURE TRAVEL ! ! [ I was super excited about that ] ) .   *First submission*
He was my best friend . There was always a connection there , noticed by all . I knew that eventually something would happen with us I just did n't know when . There were times , looking back , that I could see in his eyes that he entertained the thought of more . Prolonged exposure to each other made it worse so I can see where I went wrong getting him a job working side-by-side each other . It figures that we would start as co-workers and end as the same . A disastrous circle encapsulating what was once a true and pure friendship .   It took me a year to realize that no matter how much of my heart I poured into him he was simply incapable of loving me . Having been friends for so long I knew of his past , the dark and tormented soul who was now terrified of commitment . Was I stupid to think I was special enough to heal him ? At the time I was confident in my abilities and our relationship to be able to reach my spirit into his and banish his darkness . However , now I think I was wrong . I was wrong to think I was special and unique to anybody , especially him . There is nothing more terrifying in this world than the knowledge that you can do nothing .   I ca n't make him love me , and while he does n't I will cease to love .
Doctor Ocatavion Reed was panting so hard he felt he might die due to lack of oxygen . His hard raced faster and faster once the thought came creeping back in his mind . Dr. Reed had finally developed warm hole technology and portable at that . One evening in his free time Dr. Reed decided to tinker with his garage door opener . When Dr. Reed took the item to tinker with at the NASA headquarters he had inadvertently used the wrong gelling liquid that his lab mate was using . The gel unbeknownst to Dr. Reed the gel was altered but the changes were not recorded on the activity log . Later that night Dr. Reed got to his house and tried his new contraption . At the same time wondering where he was Lucy called Dr. Reed , who had just opened a wormhole had his minivan slowly starting to get engulfed . He shut the button off , and saw that the front end of his vehicle was missing . Dr. Reed ran inside , kissed his wife and grabbed her keys to her coupe . He raced back to the lab and looked at the logs for the gel , they were all encrypted . He thought about all the things Mark would talk about and entered Buttons the name of his cat . Dr. Reed could not keep up with the computations and notations , it was like nothing he had ever seen . NASA had developed wormhole technology the second they landed on the moon . The alarms started screeching , the computer read multiple users online ; please wait for tech support . No sooner had he left the lab that security started running after him ... .
The ground shook as the last ship took off .   `` They left me . They effing left me here on this dying planet . '' She cursed silently to herself as she realized she was alone . She had felt alone before , when she was a child and sat in the bunkers listening to the bombs go off in the distance . She had felt so isolated from the others then . An orphan , she had nobody to hide herself into like the other children . In the end days of Earth nobody cared about the orphan girl . It was much the same in her adulthood . She had never connected with anyone . She had always felt just outside the rest . How ironic that now she was truly alone . The last human on this planet .   She was suppose to have been on that ship , the last ship to take the survivors of the Great War to safety . The last ship to abandon this world of nuclear dismay before it killed more . She had got distracted by her own mind like she had always done . She had missed her escape .   She sat on the floor , curling up into herself for comfort as the tears fell and she realized the full extent of her error . As she cried , she heard noises in the distance . Ugly , inhuman noises . She became silent for fear of attracting attention . No more time for tears . It was time to fight . Time to fight for the life of the last human on Earth .
Dear Ms. Watts ,   I hated writing . I hated doing anything for school . I was n't happy with my education . The summer that I was placed in make up English , I found the first teacher that read what I wrote and cared enough to try and make it better -- to try and grow the author and poet that lives in all of us .   You were attentive . I wrote pages of nothing as I had done in every class to that point in my life and you *tore it apart* . Every sentence , you broke down . You knew it was garbage and you did n't care . You pushed me to imbue substance and meaning in to every line and told me how important word choice was . You drilled me on gerunds , sentence structure , and word connotations . Your faith in my ability , the effort you invested . Your direct unwillingness to accept anything less than the best I had to offer forced and inspired me to rise beyond mediocrity . I pity those who did not have the opportunity to encounter you or a teacher like you . Every time I write , and I debate putting the subject at the end or beginning of the sentence to achieve a specific rhythm , I think of you .   Eight years ago , I tracked you down and called you , to tell you how much it meant to me . You told me to stop . You gave me your address and told me to send you a letter . I never did . I still tell myself , `` I will . ''  
My hair stands on end , rankled by the sudden chill .     & nbsp ;     A void drifts next to the bed . Odorless . Alien .     & nbsp ;     I sound a low growl from my barrel chest . Warning . Danger .     & nbsp ;     I DO NOT COME FOR DOGS .     & nbsp ;     I show my teeth which have ended many a threat to Master 's garden , protecting His labors . Beware .     & nbsp ;     IT IS HIS TIME .     & nbsp ;     I rest a paw on His chest . My pads long calloused by the gravel and earth , my claws sharp . No .     & nbsp ;     ALL THINGS MUST RETURN TO THE VOID IN THEIR TIME . EVEN YOU .     & nbsp ;     I drag my body across His , letting our warmth combine . Exhaling slowly through my nose , I close my eyes .     & nbsp ;     I WILL RETURN .     & nbsp ;     Warmth . Love .   -- -- -- -- -     *My first time writing . I just wanted to try a very simple style for a dog . Action followed by emotion and meaning . Animals being able to see into a supernatural plane that we can not is always a fun theme too . I 'm open to critique . I remember my dogs , a cocker-spaniel / schnauzer mix and a german shorthaired pointer . I remember that on my dark days I 'd curl up on the bed next to them and take a nap . We would lie back to back and his breathing was comforting . *
`` Come on . Turn that off ! i 'm trying to sleep here . '' It grumbled .   God looked down at the bed and the being tucked inside . It reminded God of himself , but then again , God had nothing else to compare it to .   `` Please ? Just five more minutes man , come on . '' It complained .   God hesitated for a moment before dimming the light . He came down beside the being .   `` Who are you ? '' God asked .   The being sat up from the bed and with an expression of extreme loathing it spoke : `` Ugh . I went back in time to the one point i thought no one would bother me and i 'm instead kept up by YOU . Is it so much to ask for one good night 's sleep ? ''   God was annoyed : `` This is my universe ! I decide what goes on , what are you doing here ? ''   `` Trying to get some sleep ! God , you are dense . '' It shot back .   Before God could say anything more the being pulled a remote control from underneath the covers of the bed and pressed a button .   `` I 'll find somewhere else to sleep . '' It mumbled before vanishing in a puff of smoke .   For a good few moments God tried to process what just happened . With no further explanation he turned the lights back on .
His office sat 500 ft above the city ; above the crowds , the noise and the filth . Two solid glass walls overlooked the river , the sky and the rest of the city . Cars looked like ants down below . The white marble floor gleamed so brightly , an image of the chandelier that hung from the ceiling was reflected .   A sleek , uncomfortable black sofa lined a third wall and a large , glass desk sat in front of the fourth . Certificates decorated the wall behind the desk ; official documents on thick , ivory paper with more letters after the name than was worth counting . One expensive abstract painting hung above the sofa . The rest of the room was bare .   Unused pens and paper hid in the unit of drawers beneath the desk . A stack of unread files sat on top of the desk , full of unknown names and numbers that did n't matter . Or unknown numbers and names that did n't matter .   A secretary entered the room without saying a word to the man sat inside and placed a cup of coffee carefully on a black coaster on the desk , beside the stack of files . He watched as her black heels clicked against the marble tile as she left again .   He put his head on his desk and wept .
His toothy smile was breaking apart and coming back together , it looked like waves crashing on a beach . It was producing sounds that represent meaning , ( which must be what waves do as well , of course , waves produce sound conveys meaning based on perception ... of course ... ) . I listened to Travis , but his words were not in harmony with what he was *communicating* to me and everyone around me . I watched him struggle for a few more minutes , until he stopped , sensing a loss of control . I wished he were more like waves on a beach , they have no trouble conveying what the mean to say ... They simply say it .   `` Travis Wallace Chestington , do you hear yourself ? ''   He remained silent .   `` Travis , your words convey knowledge , but not understanding . That is the reason for your discomfort . Do you understand ? ''   He looked up at me , his face tormented with grief .   `` I am sorry , I am sorry , oh please forgive me ... '' He began to cry . Everyone in the room was completely still .   `` The only one you have to forgive is yourself , for ultimately you are the one who suffers the most . ''   He looked up at me , and his face brightened , his toothy smile returned , only this time there was nothing lacking in communication . All it conveyed was joy .   `` Thank you ... Thank you ... ''   `` No sweat bro . Here , get some of this shit '' I said as I heated the spoon .
We are the best . A streamlined and professional fighting force the likes of which the world had never seen , bred from the previous generation 's best and trained from an early age in the art of war .   I remember my first mission clearly . Fresh out of graduation , we were sent to ambush a battalion-strength unit that was threatening the town of Radnevo . 900 of them , and only 150 of us , but what did we care ? We are invincible .   We hit them hard , out of the darkness . Most of their artillery was wreckage before they even knew we were there . Their rearguard was neutralised in minutes : easy as a 300 on the simulations . Then we swept the village . That 's when it happened .   She could n't have been older than 13 . She was staring right at me , big eyes set in a pale face , with my crosshair in the centre . My finger tightened on the trigger . A heartbeat . A burst of fire . And pain .   It 's funny , you know . We all studied the target zones , the effects of severing nerves . A lot of us must have tried to imagine it . But nothing I imagined came close to how that felt , lying paralyzed and useless on the ground .   I have a lot of time to think back to that moment now : The corps had no further use for a paralyzed and inexperienced infantryman . But I kept her little 9mm that they dug out of my spine . It reminds me that I was one of the best .
It 's been 50 years since the great war , I looked down the barren streets which were once bustling market places . Before the war , heavy metal was a sight to behold . Now , even the toughest of men turn into mice at the sound of happy birthday .   The faint blood curdling screams of men , mixed with the diminished chords of the ukulele gang was a daily occurrence . The other clans just could not keep up . Their small size made them easily available , even allowing child musicians a chance to fight . They out numbered everyone 100:1 , violinists , their notes all fell flat . Drummers , all fell out of beat . Keyboardists , spent too much time refining their tones of war and were easily wiped out . Guitarists are still trying to out shine each other and have been at skirmish with each other since the war began . I carried my bass high and proud , we bassists were mocked at before the war for `` not being heard '' or for being the shitty guitarist in the band . But look where we are today . Firmly rooted in the rhythm , but yet able to conjure up melodic lines . We were the only ones able to withstand the onslaught of ukuleles .   I took one final look at the street , reminiscing about the days when music was fun , when music was still a hobby and a profession . Not a tool of destruction .   As that thought left my head , i heard the sound of ukuleles in the distance . Horrified I thought to myself , `` Oh no , Beiber ''   First time writing here so please be gentle .
`` As you can see from this presentation of slides , one of the many , many cultural similarities between our people , we believe with the assistance of earth we can increase our ship production by upwards of 23 % and in so doing safeguard ourselves from various cosmic terrors . In order to achieve this we would offer your people a position in our unity , and our aid in uplifting you , granting you various medical technologies as well as this commemorative plaque . ''   `` We would greatly appreciate this opportunity , but as we have tried to explain throughout this entire tour , we do n't believe your estimates could possibly be accurate . Your ships , your technology , everything is entirely organic based . We do n't see how our radically differing technology could in any way help someone as advanced , yet different as your unity ''   `` Ah , we understand your confusion now . Yes , our technology is all organic , and no , your engineering would not be of particular help . No , your position in our unity and aid in ship production will be entirely based on the trade opportunities you present to us . As long as you will agree to provide a steady supply of the crystallized vibrations of your great craftsman Berry of White , we both should prosper greatly . ''   `` Wait , you just want us in your unity so you can get some Barry White music ? What does that have to do with your ships ? ''   `` Well , we did say all our ships are organic ... . ''
`` I ca n't believe you 've never met him . He talks about you all the time . '' He sits there , gun in his lap , smiling at me . That cocky smile , the *I 'm better than you are , and you 're completely fucked* sort of smile . I try to respond , but of course , when you have tape around your mouth and sack over your head , speaking coherently is an issue . `` Really ? That 's a shame , considering you ruined his life . '' I feel a sudden breeze hit my face as the bag is ripped from me . We 're in an apartment building - one of those New York high rise flats , just been built - empty . The floor to ceiling windows are pushed open . I shiver .   My name is Dante ; I 'm a , well , I WAS a lawyer . I worked for one of the largest law firms in Manhattan , and somehow , after two drinks in my local bar , I ended up here with no memory of current events . None of my clients had ever been called 'Sizemore ' .   The man picks up a picture and thrusts it towards me . I stare at it for a few moments , then blink repeatedly . My heart sinks , and my face too , apparently .   He picks up the gun . `` Goodbye , Mister Sizemore '' .
> Good day , ms Hart .   I am Kim Smith , and I have found a letter from you . It was dated 20th of December 2010 , and it was addressed to my house . In it you talk about feeling different and like you do n't have any true friends . I would gladly like to meet you , and possibly be your friend . Since you seem to live in the city one over , would you like to meet at the Reaper 's ? I 've been there before , and it 's great . I hope we get to meet soon .   Yours truly ,   Kim Smith .   I had sent that first letter years ago . Now this stranger wanted to be my friend ?   `` Are you Rose Hart ? '' Someone behind me asks . I nod , and look at the person behind me . `` Are you Kim Smith ? '' He nods . Black hair , green eyes , casual clothes . Around my age .   Now we are really good friends , we started dating after two years , and he proposed yesterday at dinner , with a simple but beautiful ring of braided metal paperclips . We are happy , and I 've told him he is the love of my life . Our lovestory has turned out happy this far .
Madness smoked Jop , but Jop laughed harder . Jop conjured whims of chemical madness , he hallelujahed mad bliss in his mad lab science with a speed trip bump crash , dashing the pretense . Tweak brought weep came down to storm , joking out marmalade junkie porn .   Jop did n't top , did n't stop , did n't sleep . Ten more years with street trip beat doing down the cares of junked grim reap .   But box caved down and smother-licked sky . Bars been hiding Jop , Jop dun cry . Bold come down singing `` Free Go Free ! ''   Brakes been cut , but speed begets whee , with ground beef smash trap looming for he , for he bullies reaper , but reaper wo n't play when play is gon na fry disco day .   Jop even never know can he go , or will the go just torch his low , but COPE ! Hope ? nope . A ghost town soul has no troll . Just looking for Obi-wan , lost hope 's soul .   Bad lunch got Jop got lost in a gastric cocktail .   Chemical farewell .   Tummy burst lonely in a locked hostel .   1 day   2 day   3 day   4 ... A crash of welfare waltz fell door to floor , cried `` Jop is puddle dumped , trips no more ! ''   No box to view , it 's ash for you .       ( in memory of my brother , a word salad master , now four years gone )
Tony looked puzzled . Steve was just sitting there while Natasha was absently looking through the window .   Can we get back to the subject ? - said Black Widow - We are trying to find Banner .   But this guy keeps showing up . Me and Steve were the most frequent faces , we normally get all the media attention , we were expecting bruce to be the next more popular because of destroying harlem and all that stuff . But no , this guy seems to be everywhere . - Said Tony   Can the computer be wrong ?   No . It is scanning every live feed and every video and photo archive accessible on the network . The face repeats too much .. some times in two far away places on the same time .   Ok Tony , so either he is omnipresent or your computers have a glitch . - Said Steve .   Glitch ? ... how do you even know what that means ?     Thor walks in . Why are we watching that old man ? - Were n't you looking for Banner ?   Thanks ! - Said Natasha .   Wait a minute ... I know him . He was on the party we did when we obtained the scepter , he drank some of my liquor and left saying nonsense .     -What nonsense ? - asked tony     excellent , ecstasies , excelsior ... or so I remember . He tried telling me his name but he was very incoherent .     So you are an expert on earth names now ? ... What was it ?     .. something like ... Utau ...    
`` And now , '' said the conductor , her tentacled arms raised , `` in recognition of our new friends in the planet of Ee-arth , the Zorblaxian Symphony Orchestra and choir will perform what our scientists have gathered to be the Planetary Anthem of their people . ''   What ? What possible piece could she be referring to ? The Star Spangled Banner ? It could n't be . We had made it very clear that the Earth did not have a Supreme Leader , so why would they choose any one country 's anthem over another ?   An innocuous statement from one of the officials at the briefing came back to me . The Zorblaxians had known of our presence in advance , by listening to radio broadcasts . Which would mean that whatever our radios were playing at the time was essentially our species ' greeting to the rest of the universe ...   The aliens gathered their instruments in their claws , tentacles and energy-based appendages . The conducter ignited her laser baton . The entire crowd stood still as they played th first measure .   I laid my head in my arms in embarassment . I supposed this was better than starting out with intergalactic war , but not by much . Slowly I looked back up just in time to watch the choir enter :   `` This hit , that ice cold   Michelle Pfieffer , that white gold ,   This one , for them hood girls ,   Them good girls , straight masterpieces ... ''  
The vessel shook and the red warning lights that lined the hallways began to spin , sending a warm , red light across the metal walkways and silver walls . As if it was the Gods ' last , feeble attempt at stopping the fleeing vessel from escaping Their power , the engines on the vessel had died , and the only sound left inside as it hurtled through space was the ticking sound that the red warning lights made every complete revolution , and the soft , steady breathing of Thomas .   Thomas sat strapped into his chair , eyes glistening with anticipation as he stared through the window towards the black strip of nothingness that sat at the edge of the unknown . That black strip of nothingness was often said to be the end of the universe , where the universe wrapped around itself and left a small opening outwards , like an open zipper . It was believed by others that the strip was the barrier that protected this universe from the unknown .   Seconds turned into minutes , and minutes into still more minutes . Thomas sat in the darkness of the ship , its insides illuminated only by a wavering , soft red light . Long he sat there , waiting and watching as the black strip , which was void of planets or stars , or atoms , or anything at all crept closer , closer , and ever closer until finally it filled the entirety of his window , leaving him to stare simply into nothingness . And so it continued until the end of his time .  
I like the character and the setup . A couple things kept this from being a top contender for me :   * The dialog did n't feel real . It 's very stilted . Some of the things that are being said are good , but the way they 're said did n't flow naturally or me .   * I had a credibility problem when Rahul was present for Karan 's counselling session . This really is n't common , so for it to happen unremarked-upon did n't feel real at all . This undermined my belief in the story as a whole .   * In the session itself , Dr. Joshi talked way too much . A psychiatrist or psychologist 's goal is to let the patient solve their own problems , and merely to be the guide to get them there .   Bullets 2 and 3 are , however , just my understanding of the practice ; I vaguely remember maybe seeing one a few times when I was a kid , but not since . But I think I 'm correct on them regardless .   I do think the starting point is interesting , though I wonder if Karan should be starting either in a darker place or when he 's not yet completely broken-hearted to add some stakes to the story . Right now he 's a kid with a broken heart , but nothing much is at risk since his heart 's already broken and he does n't seem like he has suicidal thoughts or anything . Moving the starting point , or increasing the impact on him at start , might add to those stakes and bring the story to life a bit more .   Good luck with it ! Thanks for sharing !
I am sitting at the cash register watching and waiting while the clock slowly ticks from the 8 to the 12 when I hear my name shouted from the customer service desk , `` David , go clean the bathrooms ! They are really dirty ! '' I sigh and go get the mop and bucket .   As I walk into the bathroom I think to myself `` Why do I still work this 9-5 dead end job ? I have a college degree for Christ sakes ! '' As I open the unisex 's bathroom door I can already smell the four odor lingering around the toilet . I thank the store again that we only have one bathroom . As I open the door , I can feel and can taste the foul odor . To my dismay the odor was a huge piece of feces sitting in the toilet . I flush it and wipe the floors and leave .   As I go to punch out I hear my name get called , `` David ! Did you clean the bathrooms ? ! I know you suck at directions and you have no common sense whatsoever ! You should be called rocks , because you are as dumb as a box of rocks . '' I look over my shoulder and say `` Fuck you Chris . Fuck you , you fat piece of shit . I quit . '' I walk out of the store and light a cigarette and think `` What have I done ? That was very foolish . '' I finish my cigarette and get into my car and drive away with a sweet sweet grin on my face .
When I respond to prompts , I usually type it up in Microsoft Word and copy and paste it after doing a read-through for any major errors and for formatting . At least those I can catch within a short time span .   When I 'm writing a full-length story , I tend to go back and forth . I 'll usually start writing by typing on the computer , getting a portion out . Sometimes I 'll write the whole thing that way , which is what I 'm doing with one rather large project at the current moment . As I 'm typing it in sections , it 's easy for me to add sections in wherever I want as compared to pen and paper writing .   Other times , like with my current NaNoWriMo project , I flip-flop . I do a ton of pen and paper writing and then type it up at night . It allows me to read through what I 've done and look for any glaring errors , I sort of edit as I type when I 'm typing it up . I 'll then sometimes work further by typing and if that 's the case , I usually print the last page and begin the process all over again .
Da past few months been a dream . It crazy , really . Dey go to sleep and don ’ wake up . Dey still alive - don ’ twist me words , dey just not returnin ’ to da wakin ’ world .

But I hope dey return soon - it be getting lonely by meself .
`` Well , thanks I guess , '' I managed to spit out to the Prince of darkness , he had the same expression as ever on his face , the expression of someone who is unimpressed .   `` Look , it 's no problem , Hell needed an accountant anyways ever since God picked on up and decided to give us a budget . ''   `` I 'm just saying , it was really hard to find someone willing to give me a job in heaven , there is n't much of a reason to have money when you can instantly have anything you want , and I thought that you would turn me away , being and angel and all . ''   Satan took a long drag from a cigarette that disappeared as soon as he was done with the breath , looking off into the distance of fire , brimstone , and screams . Quite the view really , `` Eh , I 'm not really doing you a favor as much I 'm doing one for myself , '' he kept his eyes away from me , guess I was below his pay grade , `` I needed an accountant , and you happened to show up on the same day to get a job here . It worked out .   `` I just did n't think you would trust an angel to make decisions for the realm of suffering . ''   `` Have you tried trusting a Demon ? Not in their nature to be honest about the money shit . ''
`` Ethics are for the cowardly and the weak ''   `` I am aware of that , old friend ''   `` Then why do this ? Why tear down everything we built ? ''   `` The design was faulty , did n't account for our humanity . Sooner or later there would have been a rebellion , I did what I had to ''   `` Sooner or later there would have been a rebellion ? Ever heard of the term self-fulfilling prophecy ? ''   `` Unstable buildings are demolished to prevent greater damage , this was no different ''   `` You believed in what we do ''   `` When it was just us , of course . But to impose our mindset on the public ... you crossed the line there ''   `` It would have made our people strong ! ''   `` There 's more to life then strength . Culture , diversity , art ... there are other paths that have nothing to do with martial strength , paths that neither of us can see . You would ensure that none of our people will either ''   `` And what if someone comes for us ? How will your other paths save us ? ''   `` They will not be needed , me and mine will still be here ''   `` So that 's it ? You murder your friends and tomorrow it 's business as usual ? How do you justify this to yourself ? ''   `` Ethics are for the cowardly and the weak ''
`` Well spit it out already , what 's got you down ? '' Karen demanded , shaking Bill 's arm . Adam sat idly on the other side of the table as he munched his hamburger .   `` There 's nothing out there . '' Bill mumbled .   `` What do you mean ? '' She asked .   `` We finally got *it* working , remember that machine I told you about from work ? '' Bill stated , `` Well *it* finally spit out the data . And there is **nothing** out there . No life . ''   `` Well , maybe it 's somewhere you did n't look . '' Karen said , still slightly enthusiastic .   `` No . There 's nowhere we ... *it* ... did n't look , you know *it's* power as well as I do . '' Bill said . Karen 's smile dampened and the trio sat awkwardly . Adam put down his food and cleared his throat .   `` So you 're saying Earth has -all- the life in the galaxy ? '' he asked . Adam let his eyes roam around aimlessly , unsure of how to feel .   `` In the universe ! '' Bill corrected . He put his hands on his head and sighed . Karen leaned over and rubbed his shoulder .   `` Sounds harsh . You still got us though . '' Karen assured him . It did n't help .
I could n't do it anymore , i could n't handle the sadness that seemed to now be a permanent feature of their faces .   I hated drinking , but it was the only time i would forget , forget the terrible , disappointment of a person that i am .   I never meant to hit my wife , she was the love of my life , the only thing that gave me meaning , but now i had become this empty shell of a man .   The financial crisis was the beginning of it all , the domino that collapsed my life upon itself .   Then the poor job market was the next domino to fall , pushing me further into my Alcoholism .   My wife did n't look at me like she did when we were younger , free and innocent .   My children did n't speak to me anymore , this brought on the anger .   Anger and Alcohol make for a dangerous cocktail .   I did n't want to leave my family , but i knew if I stayed any longer i would only make their lives more miserable .   This is the only way out , the life insurance will give my family a better life anyway .   Click .   Bang .
Souls yearn . That 's what they do . That 's what they for .   A soul always longs for more - a deeper connection , a more vital purpose . Souls are what drive us to explore , to invent , to push beyond whatever boundary we face . Driven by our souls , mankind has undertaken the seemingly impossible , and triumphed .   We yearn . That 's who we are . That 's what separates us from the other animals . Without that yearning , without that drive for more and better , we are little more than dumb beasts . Existing , not living .   A life without yearning , without a working soul , is pleasant . Pleasant , but nothing more . It 's a lukewarm bath , daytime television , a ready meal . Fine . Not sad - you ca n't feel true misery without an understanding that it could be better . But not truly happy either . You ca n't have the peaks without the valleys , and you ca n't have either if you do n't want to climb .   More than anything else , we yearn for love . For that one perfect person who makes everything complete . Everyone searches for true love , yearns for it . The yearning makes us wonderful , visionary . It drives us to great heights .   Until we find it . When someone finds their perfect partner , their soulmate , their drive vanishes . Two matched souls have nothing to yearn for . Their lives are pleasant . Pleasant , but nothing more .
`` oh shit oh shit oh shit '' I kept saying to myself as I saw it hovering over Scott 's head . It was n't right , it made no sense , even army soldiers get a 8 at most . How the hell is Scott a 10 ?   Scott was a small shrimpy kid , he always walked funny and never looked anyone in the eye . He would be a 2 at most but the number does n't lie . The ominous 1 and 0 floating in the air taunting me . If Scott was really a 10 , I would n't want to be on his wrong side .   `` Hey Scott , how 's it going '' I ask nervously , Scott simply peered up from his book and flashed a weak smile .   `` H-hey man , it 's going alright . '' he replied , his voice was quavering , and everything in my mind screamed to me that he was n't what the number said he was , but I brushed it aside . This guy could be a school shooter , or some crazed serial killer . The only thing I knew about him was that he joined us a few days ago and his parents had not been seen before by anyone in school .   `` Wan na be friends ? '' I asked . I could see Scott 's face contort from confusion to happiness in a matter of seconds .   `` Sure ! Wan na see my parasitic twin ? ''
`` Mr. Linden , it 's past -- ''   `` It 's past visiting hours , I know , I know , '' Mr. Linden dismissively waved the nurse off . `` Miss , I 've been here for so many nights . Let these old bones stay put for a while longer ? ''   She sighed and closed the door with a soft click . *She 'll be back , * he thought . *They always give me a few more minutes . * Roger rubbed his hands , his thick calluses scratching away at each other . Decades of blue-collar work never prepared him for the staccato *beeps* that hit him , harsh reminders of who laid before him .   The doctor said she would n't have long . Her mind once wielded rapier wit , but it has been long disarmed . He was n't even sure who she was anymore . The sparse moments of wakefulness were fraught with confusion and terror , in both her and Roger . She could n't understand . He could n't understand .   A sudden knock on the door let Roger know that it was the end of the nurse 's patience . In one motion , he sat up and kissed his wife 's forehead , as he has done countless times before . *See you tomorrow . *   As the nurse took his shoulder to lead him out , they both heard a ruffling of sheets . `` Roger ? '' A voice called out .   `` Beth ? ''
It was one of those days where it was raining but sunny . I was driving east on the 10 when my copilot Abbie called it out , `` rainbow on our 10 o'clock Robbie ! ''   I buried the gas and the Hemi on my Power Wagon roared to life . I jumped the embankment and crashed onto Euclid .   There it was , straight ahead around what used to be Upland . I could feel the adrenaline coursing through my veins as I drove the ruins of downtown Ontario . Old Pacific Electric car whizzed by on my left , my onetime favorite Mexican joint on my right .   `` Abbie , get up on the turret ! We got ta be prepared for those green bastards . '' I could hear the motor on the Minigun spin up before I even finished . I smiled and thought `` Wow , I took this bitch along cuz she knew how to eat a girl 's ass just right but dayum is she on point ! ''   Getting closer .   Thought about how those awful little green people started showing up when it rained . There was nothing left to harvest anymore but they were now using our planet as a FOB . `` Not this time little fuckers , were gon na put your ugly little asses back where you belong ; Irish fairy tales and cereal boxes . ''    
We created the **Get to Know a Mod** to alternate with the other Wednesday feature , **Writing Workshop** , mostly to give poor Arch a break , because - unlike other defaults - the mods here actually generate new content on a weekly basis for the sub . Something we do n't get paid for and have to find time in our lives to do .   **Monday : ** We feature writers from the sub who generally go unnoticed . We 've actually made efforts to avoid using mods for this . Save for the times we LATER modded good contributors ( after their spotlights ) .   **Tues : ** We sticky CC/PIs that might be otherwise missed .   **Alt-Wed : ** Arch runs a workshop   **Thurs : ** We try to get people out of the Hitler , Numbers , Time-Travelling Rut   **Friday : ** Lexi fields your questions .   The weekend is for us to just BS with you and let you toss your own stuff up for everyone to see .   So every other week on one day ( so like 2 days a month ) , we let you know we are n't soulless automatons and it feels like self-promotion ? Mostly to give one of the other mods a break . We do n't sticky our writing . We do n't psudo-brigade ourselves , we just do this mod thing .   Sorry , if this sounds like the traditional grumpy-old man post , but that 's my role on the mod team . Grumpy-Old Man # 2 .
I remember when we used to look at the stars at night to find the constellations . I didn ’ t know any , but I ’ d look nonetheless . We ’ d lie back , looking up into the sparkling mess above while i tried to memorize the way the stars reflected in the mirrors of your eyes . The ground was damp , but we didn ’ t care . Our indifference towards discomfort came from our determination to just be , and nothing else . One hand held yours and the other grabbed a fistful of the dew-covered grass to hold me down and keep me from floating away . There were shooting stars , and I ’ d wish on every one .   ​But it wasn ’ t even about the stars . It was about us . It was about the way that everything I wanted to say would get stuck on the tip of my tongue in pursuit of the opportune moment of escape , and then find it when I ’ d open my mouth and let go of reserve , let audacity have control . Let it all spill out , drenching you in a sea of secrets , every awkward word swallowing me whole . Ignore my head and let my heart find the words.​   I swear , my heart played hopscotch with those skipping beats .   ​It was during these moments that we were infinite . And it is these times that I will never forget .
  It 's been a week since I came up . I ran into the first one 20 minutes after stepping foot onto a world that supposed to be ash , a world burned so bad that not even memory would remain . I do n't think the warden expected me to last two seconds . That 's why they decided to send convicts . Give the worst of us the chance to become the best if us was the PR line , but the real reason was just to make room .   What I would have given to have been back on my rack at the barracks . I was a Major in The Peacekeepers , but I had to go and sleep with the Prefect 's wife . Well , that would have probably just gotten me thrown in jail . What he saw me doing to his dear wife while I had one of the last cigars in existence , his cigar sticking out of my ass is what got me volunteered for this bold new program .   That was a week ago though . Now I was giddy , light as a damn feather . Not only had the world healed itself but there were survivors , or their descendants anyway . How they had survived much less thrive into this strange new civilization was beyond me . Idiots one and all . All these simple bastards cared about were potatoes . They ate them , worshiped them , I think they even had relations with them . I 'm going to rule the fucking world .   First thing I was going to do is change the world 's name . What the fuck is a `` Latvia '' anyway ?  
Never done one of these , but this prompt spoke to me .   We had recently met . We barely knew each other , and yet , when my mistakes caught up to me , and I felt the weight of decades ' worth of regret bearing down on me ; when I looked at myself and saw something disgusting that did not deserve to be loved , she came to me . I was blinded by my obsession with my past blinded by self-hate , yet I could *see* her ; I could see her when I could see nothing else , and when there was nothing else worth seeing ; and what was more , I could see a future , my future , *our* future .   She 's small , but when I look into her eyes they 're bigger than all the world 's problems and all its injustices and all the sins of a planet of men . Her voice is quiet , but she speaks of pain and betrayal and disease that have fallen on her , and I can not fathom how a person who has been so cheated , so maltreated , still wake and dream and laugh and love and care for her children . With a fraction of her strength I could accomplish anything , face any challenge , be one hundred times the man I am , and she makes me *want* to .   I want to give her the world though she deserves more .       **Disclaimer** : I 've never really written outside of class , so any tips/criticisms are welcome .

Capt . Gale waited patiently at the entrance to her spacecraft . The passengers were just embarking for the trip to Mars . There were the usually types of people preparing for the flight to Mars . Rich people wanting something out of the ordinary . Powerful people trying to be impressive . Even after all this time , she still felt out of place . But her simple mid-western upbringing also tended to charm the guests . After exchanging pleasantries with the passengers , she left them in the hands of the flight attendants . Sometimes it seemed silly , all the prep work took longer than the actual trip .   She entered the cockpit . If you could call it that . The cockpit really did n't look like anything you 'd expect . There was no acceleration couches or anything . Just a small dais patterned with a simple red and yellow spiral . Once everyone got into their seats , one of the flight attendants rung her up on the comm panel . `` Everything is green . Ready for transport '' .   Dorothy stepped to the center of the dais , clicked the heels of her Ruby slippers and said `` There 's no place like Mars '' .
IT 's the same man , I 'm sure of it .   I started work on this project , *They Died Too Young* , fifteen years ago . I 'd ask permission from families who lost children between the ages of 5 and 8 . I woudl attend the funerals , and in exchange , I would photograph them in their moment of grief . I would give those families both money and copies of the photos .   But as time went by , I noticed this ... man ... in them . Always hanging at the back , he would look exactly the same ; around six feet tall , with a stetson hat , and slight greying at his temples . His beard would always be silvered the way through , and he would always have dark glasses and a trenchcoat on .   This was in fifteen thousand pisctures that were due to be winnowed down to the final thirty for this project . On the last photo , which I had just developed in my dark room , the man had a message for me .   ^Do not contact me , I will contact you on the pre-opening of your show and tell you everything .   ^If you do otherwise , I shall be forced into ... unnecessary wastes of energy .   As clear as day , despite the fact that these were essentially blown up in preparation fro the exhibit .   ... Well , *damn* .
At the very peak of all possible cruelty is to take a man 's life from him and to leave him alive . To make his life your own out of some twisted sense of importance , out of amusement , greed .   Cave walls , dolomites in their skulls , we came in as explorers . Explorers , though , have been known to take things further than intended - chipped down , rotted out , brightened and fragmented the innards - what we left was merely the shell .   As it turns out , once you 're in there you can change the man outside - raise the arm , spill his drink . Make him speak with your voice , mumbling about sin , about murder - you know , harmless pranks . Just like a drone strike , I guess - if you 're not really there , neither are the feelings . They stare into the dumb oaf 's eyes and blame him for what you do .   Rewarded with total impunity to act as you please -- terrifying to think that in such a hideous act , one would find the meaning of life . And as I left , I felt changed somehow . Both more human than I ever had been , and more demonic . It occurred to me that I no longer knew the difference . It occurred to me that I do not know which I started as .
`` Call it in . '' James glanced at the car and the body , and shook his head .   His partner looked up , `` This is n't under our jurisdiction ? ''   James shook his head , `` What do you think ? ''   Winston opened his mouth , `` I think we got a mob- ''   James held up a hand , silencing his partner . `` Where are we ? ''   `` Just outside of Manhattan . ''   `` Yeah . Now , who is that ? Take a really , really close look . His face is practically gone , but the hair should help you figure it out . ''   Winston , holding his nose , bent over the body and tried to study the remains of the face .   The realization hit him like a ton of bricks . `` Oh , shit . That 's ... ''   James nodded grimly . `` Call Sheriff Wolf . Like I said , outside our jurisdiction . ''   Winston nodded , and headed over to the payphone . He put coins in , but before he dialed the number , he turned around to look at the body . `` You know , it 's funny , '' he said , surveying the crime scene . `` I did n't think you could kill fables .

*knock knock*   Jesus , that door what asshole can not leave me alone during this important time .   You see I had found him finally . The man who has plagued me for so long . I asked him the question that so many had asked me .   He replied .   ಠ_ಠ   He replies with those cold empty eyes .   ಠ_ಠ   Mocking me , again and again as I `` ask are you he ? ''   The replies are a few hours after mine every day always when I am asleep and offline . I can not get any answer except those damn eyes . But I have had a glorious idea . One for the ages . I will hire someone to track him , find him ... .hunt him .   *knock knock*   Damn that door .   It has been a days since I contacted him and the man I hired located him and emailed me . He seemed hesitant to do as I asked but there is only one thing that could be done . After the mocking and the incessant questioning every day for years I finally would have the one responsible .   It was simple the hitman would end him at the door . I would be free finally .   *knock knock*    
Hands joined together , a young boy and his father sprinted through the screams , smoke and confusion of their once peaceful city .   The boy gripped his father ’ s hand , following his every movement as they weaved their way through the chaotic , frenzied crowds .   An explosion boomed in the near distance as a plume of thick , yellowish smoke started billowing into the air .   The boy was wrapped in absolute terror , his mind trying to make sense of the hysteria around him .   The pair continued to push their way through the wheezing , howling , bloodied groups of people around them .   As they turned the street corner , a wall of rifle wielding men wearing masks stood firm .   The boy and his father stopped where they were as the wall began to encroach .   The father , face glistening with sweat , pulled his young son into a nearby alley .   The man looked unsure of what to do , and the boy took notice .   “ Daddy , I don ’ t want to be here anymore , ” the boy said feebly .   His father , eyes desperate and glazed with red , knelt before him .   “ Son , wait here and do not leave until I return. ”   The father squeezed his son ’ s hand , tight and reassuring .   For just a single moment , all was quiet .   Finally , with welling eyes , he let go .   The man disappeared into the crowd .   And there the boy stood .   Dazed , alone in fear .   Waiting for daddy .   Crying , shivering .   Waiting .  
Ink on skin , the greatest Taboo ever , the foreign hordes in faraway lands were full of them , the Inked , said to give power to those who did the unthinkable , an act that would bring fury from the gods .   But he knew differently ... They called him the 'Forsaken ' one who has been abandoned by the gods and men alike . His face , hands and feet were covered , leaving only a certain spot on his body , the size of a palm unhindered by Ink . Not many knew where it was , not many wanted to know why .   The Ink does n't give power , not in a literal sense , they gave a sense of purpose and will . His first was when his family got slaughtered by barbarians . A demon of red and green was etched onto his back , a demon of vengence . This was where the myth came from .   Then the wars happened , the crest of the Flamed Lion , onto his shoulders as he rode through the battlefield , attracting the attention of the pious , who wanted his head for a trophy . For his loyalty , he received the gift of betrayal .   The next one was the golden crown , on his forehead , the same one that fell to the ground as he removed the head from who he once called King .   Over the years , legends speak of the Forsaken , clad in cloths from many lands , covering up almost every inch of his skin . He wanders around and when the need arises and another Tattoo gets etched and another story begins .  
His stomach cringed , his sweat stained his worn clothes . It was dark , very dark , but he knew exactly where he was . It 's where he always was when this terror struck at the witching hour . It did n't come every night , but when it did it made its mark -- and a hell of a lot more than that .   He carefully tiptoed across the freezing floor , creaking boards reminding him of the pervasive silence ; a terrifying quiet that bequeathed him no promise of salvation from this terror .   He worried aloud : `` I 'll never make it '' but then , at one , a familiar voice called to him through the walls , `` You do n't have a choice '' . The voice dissipated like the calmness in his stomach .   Pushing on , the man reached out in front of him ... cold steel ... he was close , so close . Blindly he used the memory of his muscles to guide him , it was the only way .   He reached the seat , disrobed , and unloaded his taco diarrhea . He had just made it to the toilet .
The rain strikes his umbrella with a heavy 'clack , ' over and over they pelt , sounds merging into a crumbling sound that is pleasing to his ears . The sound of droplets scattering on hard stone , and the hallow sound of raindrop greeting the puddles with thousands of tiny splashes . They are falling , but his heart is aflutter , taking to the skies of which they came . He gazes up , watching the storm clouds slowly spread apart , and a golden light washes though the grey city . He breathes in the sweet scent of petrichor , so clean and crisp , and with a chuckle , his face breaks into a smile . He has been waiting for this exact moment , when thousands of tears have been transform into tiny diamonds , twinkling radiantly as they fell from the heavens above .   `` So damned beautiful . '' He says his thought aloud , extending his hand to catch the tiny gemstones . But no , he can not capture the this moment with his hands , he can only watch- Live this wonderful moment of nature . He draws his hand in , crunching the little bit of water off his hands , again , with a chuckle and smile .   It is always the simple things , that always takes his breath away .   `` Yeah , yeah , I hear ya ! '' He wipes his hand on the knees of his pants . Returning back to the safety of his home , where his wife , and two grandchildren are waiting .
My dearest , loyal subjects ,   It is with a wary heart that I write to you on this morning , as a great threat hovers over not only our fair United Kingdom , but of the whole world itself ...   In this day , we are faced with the vile creature that is Stupidity and Ignorance . The abominable thought plagues our lands , infests itself in the common people 's minds and twist them to its will .   This foe we face is a old one . It 's terrible grasp has affected us before and we have fought it over the centuries many times . We thought it had finally been quashed after the second world war , but it only hid itself to grow once again . Now in a time of great apathy , we have let it overcome us once more .   This is why I have summoned you .   The past seventy years , I have personally sought out the best and brightest minds : scientists , actors , philosophers , musicians , artists , humanitarians , and so forth . It was my hope that if the time had arisen , we should be prepared to quell this beast once more . With your collective minds , you shall have power to once again to bring sound thought and common sense to this world .   Therefore I formally summon you to Buckingham Palace , where you all shall be briefed more thoroughly on this dire situation and what duties you shall fulfill . Please come at your soonest convenience . If not , sooner .   With Highest Regards ,   H.M. Elizabeth Regina II  
Gretchen , the militant lesbian feminist socialist that had supported Sanders from day one of his bid for the presidency wakes from her 3 year coma to the year 2019 .   Coming through the haze she notices the familiar sound of television . On the television she hears reports of the Nations amazing GDP growth of 6 % last quarter , wages are up 4 % YOY , black unemployment is down 7 % since 2016 , and the nation is experiencing capital investment like nothing we 've ever seen before .   Memories begin to come back to her , she remembers being at a rally for Bernie Sanders . The moments just before she was trampled by a group of fat Sandernistas who overheard they were giving away free donuts at the back of the auditorium . She remembers that Sanders had just won New Hampshire and with all this good news about the Country that he must have won .   Gretchen begins to become over joyed in her belief that Sanders is now her president , all her efforts were not in vain . Then the news anchor releases a statement that sends her into a craze of uncontrollable emotions , `` President Trump has single handily turned our nation around and brought pride back to the greatest nation in the history of man '' .   Gretchen screams as loud as she can as she quickly loses consciousness and descends in an empty mental black abyss .   Trump 2016   Brought to you in part by   /r/the_donald
`` Name please . ''   `` Samael . ''   `` No surname ? ''   `` No . ''   `` How long have you been unemployed ? ''   `` Three weeks . ''   `` Prior work experience ? ''   `` I 've been the angel of death since II Kings . Over 100 billion satisfied customers . ''   `` I did n't see you when I died . ''   `` I take people the other way . ''   `` Mmm . Well , Mr. Samael , I 'll be honest with you . Archangels are not in high demand at the moment . We have a lot of recent ascendants and the number of positions available is n't expanding . Have you considered retirement ? ''   `` I ca n't afford to retire . The severance packages are n't as generous in Hell as they are here . ''   `` Well , I 'm sure the current situation ca n't last forever . The boss ca n't be very happy about it . ''   `` Perhaps , but to be honest , I 'm getting a bit weary of the death business anyway . ''   `` At the moment , we have only entry level positions available . ''   `` I like working with my hands . ''   `` I 'm going to start you on short term EI . Have a look at these pamphlets and take some time to assess your options . If you 're interested in agriculture , cloud seeding is a growing industry . ''   `` Thanks . ''
The elderly lady was standing on the grimy platform awaiting the train . It was apparent from her posture that she was frail , a closer look revealing her complexion to be littered with wrinkles .   I thought about the nameless people also on the platform . All leading lives with unique narratives , although none of them quite as unique as hers .   She would n't seem a valuable target for murder , given her aged appearance she would be of little worth , except to me . It 's taken a year to track her down , a period of time which must feel like weeks to her now .   The thought of one more kill to outrun the cancer indefinitely infects my face with a manic smile . In the distance , the sound of a train crawling ever closer to the platform grows louder . This train wo n't be stopping .   If her life flashes before her eyes before she dies , it make for an invaluable blockbuster . I begin to walk over towards where she is standing , and position myself behind her , I 'm five feet away from freedom .   I inhale slowly , observing the adrenaline rising inside me . I fantasize about the greatness i can achieve with her immortality and the relief of no longer watching strangers beg for mercy as i take their lives .   The train is seconds from bursting into the station , eager to reach it 's final destination , i take a step towards her , raising my hands .  
Fleet Admiral Hood glanced through the two-way mirror into the interrogation room . The man sat there , a blank expression on his face , just staring ahead at the wall , unblinking .   `` How did he wear the glasses underneath the helmet ? '' said Hood .   `` Huh . '' said Doctor Halsey . `` I never thought about that . Does seem like it would be uncomfortable . ''   `` More to the point , who is he ? '' said Hood .   `` I do n't know . '' replied Halsey . `` He just showed up one day in flash of light during the battle of Chi Ceti . He was wearing a suit of powered armor- ''   `` He had MJOLNIR armor ? '' said Hood .   `` No . It was orange and did n't have a shield , but it held up pretty well against Covenant weapons , so we thought we could improve it . ''   `` Why did you choose him for the program ? ''   `` Well , we asked him . ''   `` And he said `` yes ? '' ''   Halsey scratched her head , a confused look on her face . `` Well , he did n't say `` no . '' ''  
`` Let me get a pikachu '' I Exeggute , my voice sounding Horsea . Her eyes Flareon as she Weedles over to me . I catch her soft Jigglypufff giggle . I 've known this Vulpix since we were teens . My mind is all Tangelaed up . Who would 've know after all these years , her heart still Ekans for me . I did n't want to Sandshrew what felt like our last Chancey . The last time we saw each other , I was so Tentacruel . She had caught me Lickitunging her friend , sitting in my Lapras , caressing her Voltorbs . I looked up at her and told her that she was `` just Muk to me now '' . I had heard about her trying to Rhydon some guy and I wanted to make sure she knew I was Goldeen without her . But I was n't . My heart felt Wartortled .   `` You know , I did Raichu '' she Machokes some tears . I Fearowed she 'd say that .   `` You only wrote Clefables '' I Gloomily say . My mind still Haunters the memories of her and that guy 's Ryhorn . I 'll never be able to Zapdos the bad memories .

The Recursives recursively recurse on themselves in a temporally unified way that an Earthling can not understand : on earth information creates energy systems to reproduce that produce more energy systems that generally tend towards adding another information system which in turn requires a new energy matrix to maintain itself .   Note , this is all simplified for the enlisted sailors of spaceship earth . Officers of spaceship earth should look elsewhere in more advanced textbooks .   The Recursives can be considered an n-by-m matrix where earth history , earth life , and humans can be consider a 1-matrix . That is , scalar . Simple . Stupid . Dumb .   Another way to put it is that a human sits at a computer and types because his brain is functioning and releases dopamine as he does so , thereby approving the energy usage which is prescribed for by his genes . The Recursives , on the other hand , sit at their photics create what we might call brains solely because they both have lots of carbon in them and then store hydrogen in them because they want to make terabytes of data made out of burning water .   And thats just backwards . Recursives also go sideways and charmed ways , too . Sometimes they do it all at once . As written above , the recursives must be considered by us scalar folk to be matrices .
When I asked granny about the city , why it looked so odd , and who had made it , she told me a story .   ``   A long time ago , long before I was born , this world was not like it was now .   There were no people living here , it was a dead land . We used to live in the stars . This place was nothing but an anchor , my granny said , an anchor between the stars .   Then It came . Machines ''   What are machines granny ?   `` I do n't know dear . But they were great and terrible things for our ancestors . My granny said that this world was all one great machine once . But no longer .   All the machines stopped working , and we were forced from the stars . We were left here on this planet , the world broken and jammed , and we rebuilt .   Of the few who ask , many dream of once again living in the stars . They describe their dreams with intensity , and follow their thoughts .   The machines still fail .   Nobody knows why .  
One should tell young naive idealists such as myself that re-writing history can go awry .     In fact , they should just let us make the mistake and pay for it .     Thomas Wilsom Wang Xin Zhang was my given name . I adopted a far more conservative name in Arabic of Nasser and went back to change the world as we know it .     As it turns out , it is n't as simply as turning a page and erasing a sentence . Sometimes you have to get a bit dirty . I killed a child who went under the name of Islam 's future creator and his guardians .     In my naivety , I sought to carve a name out for myself . I began building support by trading goods between tribes , settling debts , uniting families . Families turned into communities , communities into tribes . Soon , I sought to create an Empire .     But in the end , sometimes you get what you want , sometimes you do n't . Either way , you will lose .     In killing Mohammed , the prophet , and tempting fate , I become the future founder of Islam .     So much for that . I guess it 's back to the drawing board .
`` Main battery to on . ''   The spaceflight engineer flicked two switches on the control board . `` Main battery on . ''   `` Reactor to off . ''   `` Reactor off . ''   The commander 's voice carried the unaffected confidence of an aerospace veteran . `` Mass buffer to on , electronics to mode two , and bring orbit down to mission window . ''   `` Yes commander . '' The lights in the cockpit dimmed and the ship shuddered to life as its engines ignited . Below loomed the void . The altimeter dropped .   `` Probe release to ready . ''   `` ... ''   `` Probe release to ready , officer Dayton - `` The commander 's voice wavered with the name of his subordinate as he realized he was alone .   The commander clutched his head and vomited , a sharp pain - like a frozen razor - moving up his spine . The floor of the cockpit gave out beneath him , and he begain to cough up water as he fell . He was seven , again - he had been horsing around back at grandpa 's lake house , but this time when he fell off the canoe his sister could n't find him in the muck fast enough .   The UNS matured without its most influential figurehead , funding fell through , and the mission became a pipedream - a forgotten memory . The universe remained .
We are at the vets . I only like this place because they give me cookies . My masters surround me the youngest is trying really hard to sit still . It 's like they knew something I did n't . I hope this was n't like another time after that strange lump appeared . Then I felt sleepy and woke up with a cone on my head . They kept it on for a few weeks . I was so emberessed , but they all loved me just the same . That was so long ago though . I could still run then . I still wanted to eat and play then . The young master finally stood up and hugged me . She did n't move so I gave her kisses it always made her happy . This time she cried . Why was she crying ? Did I do something wrong ? I give more kisses and weakly wag my tail . She smiles slightly . That makes me happy . Now the doctor comes in . I do n't get a cookie this time . I do n't really want one anyway . The doctor has a needle . I 've seen these before , but this one seems different . I feel sleepy now . I hope I do n't wake up with a cone on my head again . `` I love you Bear '' my young master tells me . She hugs me again until I close my eyes .
*Have n't read the original source material yet so I 'm basing this off the character from the TV show*   It had been a long time since anything of any real significance had happened at Hogwarts . Things went more smoothly and the school was ... a school and things had to carry on . But in the years since the battle of Hogwarts the headmasters have given greater attention to students being taught proper defense against the dark arts . But even as things changed they remained the same ; somehow the tradition of the notoriously short tenure of its professors had endured . But this year was a bit different . Every year the professor for defense against the Dark Arts would usually be an Auror or some famous wizard or witch ( on at least one occasion one of those that fought in the battle ) but this year everyone was burning with curiosity about this knew professor who , if the stories were to be believed allegedly was n't even a wizard . The students were already anxious as he strolled into the classroom over an hour late , looking like he 'd been drinking . Shirt creased and untucked , with a tie loosely draped around his neck ; with a lit cigarette between his lips as he took to the lectern .   `` Alright , listen up you little shits . I 'm here to teach you about all the horrors and evils of the world that you have never begun to imagine and I will show you how to fight them , or at least die slowing them down . My name is John Constantine ''
Through the dust and smoke , just louder than the citadel 's alarms came a voice . The voice of a woman at her end .   `` You do n't get it hero . You do n't understand the true villainy here . ''   The dust shifts for a moment , revealing a woman , her life slowly draining away , surrounded by her allies , already dead . The council of seven deaths .   `` You do n't realize the doom you have brought upon the people you came here to 'save . ' '' She says with a slight chuckle , despite her pain .   After a short coughing fit she continues , cutting off the hero before he can continue . `` We may have taken the world through death and destruction , but it was a world already broken . A world falling to famine , pollution , and disease . But I ask you , where does it stand now ? ''   The villain closes her eyes , but keeps speaking , not letting the hero reply . `` I 'll tell you where it stands . World hunger was abolished , everyone works , and everyone eats . The petty wars that were waged across the globe ended . Diseases thought incurable have nearly vanished . ''   A slight smile graces her lips . `` Sure , everyone was 'oppressed , ' but no one goes hungry or is homeless are they ? No one suffers from lack of healthcare . Suffers sickness from poisoned water or air . ''   The hero 's face pales as the woman gasps out on last jab , `` who was the real villain ... ''
We slowly fade into Obama sitting at his desk with his feet kicked up and all alone .   * '' Yes , the Nation will rise as one with Obamacare . Speaking of , Obama has to take care of himself '' *   Obama hangs up his phone and yells ,   * '' Biden ... .Biden '' *   Biden walks into the room with a smile on his face .   * '' Yes sir ? `` *   * '' Who was that man we met in California last year ?

This paper we smoke is our Constitution . Biden give me a beat '' *   Biden starts to beat box .  
`` What is dead ? I do n't understand that word , '' Leilei said . She continued to brush the hair of her doll without looking up at her father .   `` It means she 's gone , sweetie . '' Tears welled in his eyes .   `` When is she coming back ? '' Leilei asked .   `` She 's . . . not coming back , '' he answered .   For the first time , a look of concern crept over Leilei 's face . She looked up at her father . `` I do n't understand . Did she disappear ? ''   `` No , '' Marek began cautiously . `` Her body is here , but her mind , her spirit . . . it 's left her . Her body is . . . cold . Like a shell , with no life force in it anymore . ''   `` Is she sleeping ? Is dead sleeping ? ''   Marek rubbed his hands together . `` Dead is *like* a sleep . But it . . . lasts forever . Do you understand , baby ? She 's never going to wake up . She 's gone . She 's gone from us forever . ''   Big tears fell down his cheeks . Leilei put her doll down , and he could see a real look of panic set in her eyes .   `` Show me , '' she demanded . `` Show me the dead that has mommy . ''    
I 'd be going out with an old friend today , the thought stuck in my mind , but that was hours away . So I sat down in the only comfortable seat in my apartment , a couch in front of my TV , only I did n't remember if it was on or off when I sat down . The thought of it edged into my mind . Just static . I was going to reach over to the remote but I was too tired . I shut my eyes , and the colors began to fade to black . Someone 's voice on the TV . It echoed in my mind , but I do n't remember the words , they were quiet .   It shook in my lap , first I thought it was the remote . Whys my remote shaking ? And I wake . Confused , I put the phone on my lap to my ear .   `` YOU STUPID SLOW FUCK ''   The words were needles . I drop the phone .   `` What the fuck ? '' I fumble for the phone .   `` -DEAD , DRIVE NOW , GUN IT , FLOOR IT , DRIVE OR YOU 'RE DEAD . ''   I 'm in a car . Too tired to think . I drive .   Radio silence . He 's waiting .   `` GO RIGHT ! GO RIGHT ! ''   Dark empty streets . Nothing suspicious . Feel the dread .   This ca n't be real . This is real . I drive .   `` Fuck , whats - ''   `` SHARP LEFT ! ''   Adrenaline , surprise , calm .   This is home . How long ? Ca n't remember .
It was inevitable . That 's what everyone said when Jarrett left me . You ca n't fight your mark . He was destined for Lyddie and the tiny Eiffel-tower-shaped mark on his wrist proved it .   He had n't cheated ... he just found his other half . The engagement ring had been a mistake ( no sane person would ever propose to someone who was n't their mark-mate ) but you ca n't hold a man to a mistake . When Lyddie 's sleeve rolled up in the library , he had done what was right and followed his fate .   `` What 's your mark again ? Have you tried findyourmark.com ? Gone to the registry ? '' Good meaning friends , family , and acquaintances would ask . Find your mark-mate , they implied , and do n't begrudge Jarrett his .   All but my mom . When I told her Jarrett had found his match , she just held me and cried . Because she knows what no one other than me and Jarrett know , that I do n't have a mark . I was born without that convenient little label that tells you your soul mate . Probably because I do n't have one . I am a born spinster .   The doctors call it a birth defect . A rare one . So rare that I 've yet to meet anyone similarly cursed . So I finally accepted my fate- accepted that there was no half to complete me . I was born to be alone .
It was nice not having to clean up after myself . Having people over ? Made a mess of breakfast ? Do n't worry , Zombie-Jeeves will get it . The housekeeping apocalypse was n't so bad at first .   But try as they might , they could n't get themselves completely clean . The zombies were infectious despite all the scrubbing and bathing . Most people knew to let them into your house , but not to actually touch them . They 're not pets , for God 's sake , they 're maids .   Maybe it only seemed like most people knew because the ones who did n't were zombies now . Eventually the ratio shifted , there would come to be more zombies than people . Nobody knew we had to keep the world messy to keep them busy . So yeah , they caught up to us .   I was at Trader Joe 's when it happened . The zombies ran out of things to clean , and they took to the well-manicured streets . All the cleaning and health-consciousness , we should have known what would be next when they got hungry .   I dropped the bag of quinoa I was holding when the zombie horde crashed through the window . Some of them stopped to pick up the pieces of glass , but the rest came right for me . Lurching in that slow zombie-shuffle , and droning that monotone demand :   `` Graaaaaaaiiiinsssss ... ''
And yet , the city remained .   It had faced gruesome wars and the harshest winters , yet the city remained . It was a shining beacon of hope in the darkness of the Earth . Millions flocked daily to it 's homely golden walls , hoping for that feeling of safety that enveloped you like a warm fire in the snow , and were granted their wishes .   The horizons were ever flecked with the white sails of ships , those of the fishermen , those of the travellers . Not even the blackening clouds of thunderstorms could churn the waters of the sapphire of the ocean .   It was thriving , it was plain to see . This place of happiness was desperately grasped for by humanity , a want , a hunger , seated in the deep-set entitlement of man .   One bad deed can ruin it all . As the tyrants of the other nations grew in fury and jealousy , they conspired together in order to destroy what they could never have .   Like an ant under a giant 's thumb , the city was wiped out . The walls crumbled , and the rains washed away the weeping that mourned the loss of their paradise .   Without life , the buildings lost their solidarity to plants and overgrowth , the streets silver pavings stripped down by the birds .   And yet , the city remained .
The sound on the line could be a bad connection , or heavy breathing . Either was likely , but neither got it just right . There was something reminiscent of life support in the breathing .   `` I have an offer for you , '' the voice said , `` One I believe you may find quite compelling . ''   `` I 'm listening , Mister Creepy . ''   `` There is a ship . It is called the 'millenium- ''   `` Whoa , hold up one moment , Mr Bader '' Nathan interrupted , his voice growing slightly fainter , `` Miss , M- miss ? I asked for steamed milk , and this has whipped cream . I hate being *that guy* , but I 'm doing a no carb thing and- okay , thanks . Sorry . ''   There was a pause during which the breathing continued uninterrupted . The words of Nathan 's first acting teacher came back to him then , *No matter how much they 're promising , no matter how great it sounds , never ever take a job your agent has n't signed off on . * This whole thing seemed about two degrees off the level no matter what angle he looked at .   Nathan Fillion disconnected the call without another word . Sometimes the best decisions happen when you 're complaining about a latte .  
He coughed into his arm . Blood specked the bandages that wrapped the IV around his wasted limb .   `` Please sir , tell me again how you prepared the tomato sauce , '' I said .   The pizza man 's voice mumbled incoherently , the translator looked at me and shrugged an answer .   I was frantic , but I kept my voice as steady as possible as I spoke to my translator . It took us five years to find this man , the last pizza maker on earth , and only five days to assemble a team to gather the fragments of information held behind those cataract eyes . Now we had maybe five minutes before the secret to what was once the most important staple of the American fast-food diet was lost forever .   The pizza man took into his lungs what would be his last taste of this world , then spoke clearly . I remained fixed on my translator , even as the final vestige of a more delicious age turned cold . The translator turned to me and said , `` Guys , I worked the cash register at Domino 's . ''
I 'm sorry to do this to you . Really , you do n't know how sorry I am . I 've loved you from the moment we 've met . I 've never wanted anything in this world but to make you happy . Every time you 've cried all I wanted was to kiss you all over just to make you stop . Every time you got angry , I just wanted to jump up and down and spin around and do funny little dances to get you laughing again . And when you were happy , when WE were happy - those days were the best , were n't they ? But it 's over now . It 's all over . And I 'm so sorry for doing this to you , it 's just that I 'm old now . I 'm tired . Everything hurts .   You 're crying again , and I wish you were n't . I want you to know I 've always loved you . You were the best person in my life . You were all I ever could have asked for . Every day we were together you made me happy . The doctor is going to give me the shot now . You 're going to hug me . That 's okay . I like your hugs . Just hold on . I 'm just going to go to sleep now . It 'll be easy for me ... and we 'll be together again soon . I 'll wait for you . Wherever I go , I 'll always wait for you . You 're a good boy . You 're my good boy . I love you .
I feel Their gaze almost every moment now . They 're searching for me . I do n't know who They are . Sometimes just a few , sometimes many . I do my best to blend in . I try to be nondescript . I 'm just another person with no reason to stand out . If I look the part , if I do n't show myself , They 'll miss me or they 'll grow weary of the search and move on .   Yet it has never been that way before . They 'll hunt me . I can feel Them examining every little detail . In the end , I can never quite fit in . There 's always that *something* that sets my apart . And so They find me , and I 'm forced to start over . Turn the page as it were .   That 's been my whole life . I can never be close to anyone because They will find me and I 'll be forced to move on . I can never be myself . I do n't know what They want , but I know there 's no escaping . At this very moment , there are eyes scanning all around , looking for me . Waiting for me to make a mistake and stand out . I 'm terrified they 'll find me again .   Oh , right . Hi , my name 's Waldo . This is my first time to a group session .
Boy meets girl .   Boy likes girl .   Girl is indifferent to boy .   Boy displays his physical strength .   Girl yawns .   Boy successfully debates other intellectuals .   Girl leaves before the end of the debate .   Boy writes girl a heartfelt and expressive poem .   Girl gets uncomfortable at this excessive emotional display .   Boy tells a very funny joke , with perfect timing .   Girl laughs so hard the Mountain Dew she was drinking comes out of her nose .   Boy starts telling another joke .   Girl interrupts him by kissing him .   Boy suddenly realizes the absurdity of the situation , and starts laughing uncontrollably while girl is still kissing him .   Girl stops kissing boy , and asks why he 's laughing .   Boy tells girl they must be in a movie or a bad short story , because this is just too ridiculous .   Girl laughs , then takes another sip of Mountain Dew .   Boy kisses girl on the forehead .   Girl is silent for a moment , then she asks what 's next for them .   Boy shrugs , the tells girl he 's just happy they can finally be together .   Girl smiles contentedly , and leans her head on boy , who puts an arm around her .   Four and a half years later , boy and girl get abducted by aliens who perform gruesome biological and psychological experiments on them , but that 's another story entirely .
TIFU by breathing fire     Okay let me first get this out of the way , being born half dragon is not easy . You see when my mother was out searching for the kingdom 's lost treasure she wandered into the cave of a vicious and total asshole of a father , Steve .   The next part is something that I do n't really like discussing but I feel the need to explain my half-dragonness ... Let 's just say it *really* burned when she peed . Anyways 9 months later she popped out and egg and in another 2 months I came out a toddler with wings .   Fast forward 25 years and there I am flying southwest , in coach of course , fucking assholes charged me for 2 seats because of my wings , racist bastards . Anyways I get up to drain the lizard when the stewardess comes by with the tray of drinks . Now me being the carnivorous guy I am I ate the new huge knight burger from burger king before the flight and a rumble suddenly hit me .   A massive burp came bellowing out my belly as she passed me and of course it caused my ignitor to kick in and I emersed a fireball the size of a basketball towards the tray . The tray caught fire and exploded killing 6 people.. So the plane had to make an unexpected stop in Arizona , so now I 'm stuck in the God forsaken airport waiting for another flight .   TL\DR   If you have wings , use them .
‘ No way , dude . You could never pull that off. ’   ‘ Ha , watch me then . I ’ ve been practicing , you know. ’   ‘ Even then , man . You know how high we ’ re standing here ? At least twenty meters , instant suicide ! ’   Harper said nothing as he looked over the edge , frowned his brow and shook his head . ‘ I can survive that. ’   David sighed . ‘ All right man , if you want to ruin our team ’ s score , go ahead and fuck it up for all of us . Who cares about the team , right ? ’   His companion broke into laughter . ‘ Great , all the confirmation I needed . Thanks man , I ’ ll make sure to thank you in the compilation. ’   David watched with a blank expression as his friend took a few steps backwards and started running towards the ledge the two of them had been standing near . ‘ Wait , stop ! ’ he shouted , but Harper just smiled and took the leap . One turn , two turns , three – and *bam* – a no scope right into the face of the enemy camping underneath them . *He fucking did it* .   ‘ Saw it all ? Got it on tape ? ’   David stared disbelievingly at his mate , indeed twenty meters lower than him , looking at him with a shit-eating grin . Harper shook his head , quietly mumbling to himself , ‘ I ’ ll be damned , the fucker equipped lightweight… ’  
Dear S ,   Your story changed so many different times and was never the same . Why anyone believed you I have no idea . The accused had a bad rep so you used that to your advantage . You had so many mental health issues , that even as a teenager I recognized . Your mom was too blind to see it . I hope you got the help you needed .   You tore a man 's life apart , stole from his mother and then ran away to a neighboring town trying to hide . I saw you change directions in the store and I saw you try to hide when driving down the road . Do n't think I did n't notice you , I did , especially when I came into your place of employment . I chose to ignore you and not let you get any kind of emotional reaction from me .   I do n't use the word hate lightly . I specifically do n't use it when talking about people . I dislike them but I do n't hate . Honey , I hate you and that winner of a mother too . There 's a special place in hell for you .   Wishing you hell ,   A .  
`` The hell is this ? ''   `` The hell is what ? ''   `` Do n't you see it ? ''   `` Are you talking about the red thing ? ''   `` What red thing ? Do n't you see the blue thing in the middle of our living room ? ''   `` Yeah , but does n't the red thing weird you out more ? ''   `` WHAT RED THING ? ''   `` The one next to the blue thing , maybe ? Are n't you listening ? ''   `` What in the hell is going on here ? ''   `` Aliens ? ''   `` How could it possibly be aliens ? ''   `` I 'm just guessing , are n't I ? ''   `` Oh man , are you freaked out ? ''   `` Do you think the red and blue thing will make a purple thing ?   `` What ? ''   `` Did you ever study the color wheel in home-school ? ''   `` Why should I care if they make a purple thing ? ''   `` Would n't it be interesting ? ''   `` Why are n't you more freaked out there there is a blue thing in our freaking living room ? ''   `` Why do n't you see the red thing ? ''   `` WHAT FREAKING RED THING ? ''   `` You know , right next to the ... hey , where did they go ? ''   `` They 're gone ? Just like that ? ''   `` Now I 'm confused . ''   `` Think you 're they only one ? ''   `` Wan na get a drink ? ''   `` I ... oh why not ? ''
Their blank stares told me simultaneously nothing and everything .   I was about to die , I knew it , they knew it , it was obvious . My kidneys and liver had shut down and I only had a day or two before I was going to see the bright lights again . It was this `` again '' statement that had them going . I could see their eyebrows shoot up , jaws opening ready to correct me .   Had n't they done this before ? Jogged the rewind a few decades ? I mean , I knew it was n't legal or moral or something , so no-one talked about doing it , but was n't it common ? Just go back a few years and live them again , try to do it better ? I mean it was just like smoking weed , was n't it ? Most people have , just precious few admit it ?   I shrugged , `` Believe me or not , you just concentrate on a time in your life you want to revisit , and the light at the end of the tunnel is your eyes opening that day . Sure you forget a bunch , but it 's not rocket science ! '' My son looked to be on the verge of tears , turned to my sister and asked her how long I 'd been delirious . My own flesh and blood !   Well , what did it matter . I could go early if I tried hard enough , no way they could stop me , and I 'd just explain it more gently next time . Eyes screwed tight , hold my breath , GO !
`` That dumbass still has n't figured it out . `` , I hear a voice in my house . What the fuck is going on ? I sneak in , alarmed that someone is in my house . I pick up my glock 17 hidden in the umbrella holder ( compliments of my wife ) . I hear faint chatter , like on a phone . Is there a thief in my house that took the time to call someone using my phone ? I 'm beyond confused . This literally makes no sense . I walk five feet into my house , trying to be stealthy , the voice gets very quiet , and then silent . Did he hear me ? I sneak closer to the doorway into the kitchen where I hear the voice from . `` Oh shit . '' A very quiet voice informs the person on the other end that they have to go . I round the corner glock extended , my dog looks back at me . Guilty eyes , phone on ground , sitting next to recently unopened cookies . My dog begins to explain , `` I was talking to my girlfriend '' , `` I was n't talking about you . `` , `` I 'm your best friend , remember ? '' . I pull the trigger as he springs for my throat , he ca n't live with the fact that I know . I ca n't live with it either . I just killed my best friend . The gun goes to my own head , I ca n't go on . Goodbye world , see you soon Ralph .
`` Larry died . ''   `` What ? ''   `` Like an house cat dies , you know , dead . Not alive . ''   `` Oh . ''   `` Yeah . ''   `` Well that 's a bummer . When are we getting a new one ? ''   `` What ? ''   `` A new Larry , when can we get a new Larry ? ''   `` Mac , you ca n't get a new Larry , Larry is dead . ''   `` Yeah , but you said it was like a pet , and when a pet dies , you get a new one . So when can we get a new Larry ? ''   `` This is n't how this works ... ''   `` Sure it is , my dog Spike died lots of times when I was a kid , we just brought him to the vet and they made a new one . Same Spike , just new . ''   `` We ca n't clone a new Larry . ''   `` Why not ? ''   Pause .   `` Fine , come one . Let 's go dig up Larry . ''   `` Cool ! But the vet 's closes in like two hours , lets be quick . ''
I was fine with most of the changes . They were mostly nuances that any normal human would have missed , anyway . And they always happened subtly , as if easing me into a newer world every time . I lived in Southern California for a while , and I think two years ago it was Kyoto , Japan . There was an instance where McDonalds did not exist , and another world where the USA was something else entirely .   There was one thing that always remained the same , though . One thing that remained constant and beautiful and that was Emma .   In most of the worlds she was Emma , but she had gone by Monica before . She was 26 now with brown hair that alternated between ponytail and curls . She was 5'4 '' and loved wearing oversized hoodies . We met back in college and I loved her more than I could bear . She liked cuddling late into the morning , she had a smile to die for , and her favorite food was normally pizza or fried chicken . Sometimes she 'd want to talk about having children , and other times she was as free spirited as ever .   That was okay . No matter what world I woke up in , Emma was always there with me . In this way could I tolerate the ever changing universe ...   So why , I asked myself many years later , holding the bottle of pills , face drenched in tears and regret ,   ... why did she disappear from this one ?

No one understands what it 's like , immortality ... Everyone I loved , dead , the black plague destroyed my life . When death granted me immortality I came back and everyone I loved , died of the plague .   My only friend was death , for he had no friends as well . We went on travels across the world , I saw the wonders of the world , I helped the plagues cure spread , but death became tried once the American and french revolutions started .   I was alone , he helped me move to America , I tried to slow down death 's work . Stop wars , cure disease that was all I did , I created NATO , the UN , and the EU , I tried to stop the spread of communism .   No one listened , death never stopped working . I needed to create world peace ! I worked as hard as I could . Until war broke out , the leader of North Korea decided to end the United States , people called it WW3 , nukes flied across the sky , until the world was reduced to fallout .   I simply gave up , there was nothing I could do .   Europe fell , then China and Russia , slowly the world fell . We had fallen back to the times when I died the first time . Me and death reunited , today we rule the world , trying to create the perfect world .
The world is nothing and we are nothing . We all died . Our souls are the ocean and the ocean is us . Everyone is speaking yet no one hears anything .   I know . We 're lost . Time and space are no more . But something of us is still here . I still remember myself . Warmth , sun . Long dark hair and a dimpled chin . Laughter . That should n't be happening . I do n't know how I know it , but I do . Their chatter is driving me crazy . I do it too . It 's like that in here , everyone yelling , talking , trying to tell ourselves who we were . Thing is , we do n't want to forget . Maybe a glitch , since that 's not how it was supposed to go .   Some of it is not mine . I never had a dog , nor a son .   We are not navigating , since that would imply purpose . There 's no boat . Just the ocean .   Then I saw them . Coming towards us . Unhurriedly . Graciously avoiding planets , passing through space as if they were floating flower petals from a dream .   They were coming for us . I understood then , that 's what we are . Meal for the cosmic whales .
The machinery never stops . It rumbles on through the night , the vibrations make the walls of Long 's tiny dorm shudder . The other workers snore and moan in their sleep . Their combined heat leaves condensation on the concrete walls and floor .   Long lays back in his bunk , the metal bar of the bed frame pressing into his lumbar , the pain a minor throb compared to the clutching agony in his chest . Long counts the minutes until dawn , when shift change will happen and the night shift workers will return from the factory floor and Long and his crew will switch places with them . He counts down each second like a prisoner awaiting execution .   When the dawn comes there is no pounding on the door from the dorm master . There is no uniform footsteps in the hallway . His dorm mates sleep on . Long tries to enjoy this temporary respite , but the interruption to the routine makes him uneasy . Eventually he rises from his bunk and wanders into the hallway .   The dorm hallway is gone , the ratlike tunnel replaced by a dark tunnel . At the end is an open door , bright sunlight spilling from the open crack . Long can smell the fresh cut grass and riverbeds of his home town . Long hesitates at the cusp of the door .   From the other side , Long hears a voice he has not heard since his distant childhood . His grandmother calls to him : `` Do not be afraid , Long . Your shift is over . '' Long steps into the light .
The knight marched on , through fields and over grand hills- his humble armour gleaming the whole way along . Across ruined settlements he strode , in the wake of the beast 's wrath . As an honest man , he took little from the shells where good people once stood and smiled . Only that to eat when he would otherwise starve , or when his armour would crumble on his back , when his very blade would snap at the first sign of threat .   Yes , he admired his own bravery from time to time . One tends to become somewhat self-absorbed when they 're alone , moreso when on a quest to save lives . Many nights he spent watching the lights on his helm bounce off of the mirrored buildings that lined the path he walked .   When the march had been weeks long , he began to find himself surely closer to the source of destruction . The corpses of honest people were fresher , not yet ravaged by wild animals . Closer he came , every step bringing him closer to delivering justice . Fires raged here , and children breathed their last breaths at his feet as he marched .   Before he knew it , he laid his eyes upon the beast itself . The knight ceased marching .   `` Taste vengeance , you mons- ''   The man in the immaculate black suit turned and shot the knight dead . He stood over his body and crushed his LED visor under his boot , then snapped his sword in a crack in the pavement . The vacant cities continued to burn .
I slowly approached the dimly lit room , the smell of iron filling the hall . It was so strong it coated the inside of my mouth with the taste of a cut lip .   What I saw in that room will never leave me . A slick pool of red sticky liquid gathered at her feet . That 's when I noticed my limbless daughter being assembled into a tinned monstrosity .   Metal hung loosely from the torso of my little girl . Her arms and legs had been replaced by glimmering threads of intertwined silver .   I felt as though I was stuck in time unable to let out a cry or stop 567 from her sickening work .   567 's head twisted mechanically towards me . A wide smile spread across her face `` I no longer need to work master , our daughter can go in replacement of me '' . Her hands did n't rest , they continued to build her construction as though I was n't there .   I thought I had taken good care of my robot self , giving 567 all she required but I guess she was tired of working day in and day out .   I was so proud watching our little girl walk down the street on her way to her first day at the factory .
I have always led a simple life . Every day would be more or less the same , I would rise at 08.00 , then I would sit in the chair for an hour to wake up . Then I would go out and farm the fields for a good 8 hours and top the day off with another solid session of chair sitting .   All the other villagers living nearby where much the same , sure their routines were different , but predictable all the same . That all changed when he arrived .   Tales of his deeds preceded him , he had slain dragons , battled Giants , saved cities and some even whispered that he was the leader of the assassins guild . I still have trouble believing these things , because everytime I see the bastard hes being chased by the city guard for stealing spoons ( hes not what you would call stealthy ) . He never defends himself , he barely has the strength for a sword , and inept is an inadequate word to describe his ability with a bow . Ive seen him cast fireballs , but only at chickens , in fact the only remarkable thing about this man ( aside from his flagrant disregard for a good routine ) is his acrobatic ability . He jumps to areas unreachable by mortal man . He was last seen jumping over the city walls and falling through the ground .
It knew , somehow . It understood that there was a strangeness to its existence , a pleasant strangeness . Pleasant that , as its umpteenth generation of progeny whizzed around frenetically , almost desperate in their pursuit of life , it persisted . It still whizzed , and whirled a little bit , that was simply what it did . But there was a ... practiced feel to the random movements that propelled it towards food and and sex . That 's what the strangeness was , it was coming to realize : memory .   An interesting concept for one so driven by instinct , without an extensive neural network to manage information . It could n't fathom how that had happened , its longevity and the accompanying familiarity with being alive , and did n't really care to . All it knew , somehow , was where to feed , and how , and where to reproduce , and how . It did not behave *better* than its progeny , or even that differently . Just a little slower . A little more practiced .   And so it dove down from the heights it had come to prefer , near the ceiling and the blooms of light , down into the food bin , carelessly left cracked open by the normally fastidious creatures who inhabited this place . It sought out its favorite dish , pizza crust tinged with Dr. Pepper , and ate .
Okay so I figured I should at least give my own prompt a try . Here is an attempt at my all time favorite short stories in /u/RimoBentley 's . I fear I did n't nearly do it justice ...     There was a man at sea for days ,   He saw not the land mass in the haze ;   A light to guide him did seem true ,   When he did crash out of the blue .   *****   He woke to see a man , Zar , there ,   Whos guard did carry him up the stair ;   In house above the open sea ,   The light , said Zar , was a trap for thee .   *****   Zar told the man he would be the hunt ,   With only a knife the man ran out front ;   For hours three the man had fled ,   And left some traps to make Zar dead .   *****   Zar not dead did chase the man ,   Off a cliff he did jump , his only plan ;   Sure that he could do no wrong ,   Zar went home , the night was long .   *****   From deep sleep Zar did awake ,   To find the man ’ s death was just a fake ;   The two did fight for death and life ,   Then Zar did die by the man ’ s knife .  
There was blood and glitter everywhere .   It was like some kind of crazy Stephen King shit , only for real . The wall was splattered with it , the chandelier had become some kind of twisted disco ball , and the rest seemed the aftermath of a rave on Halloween , set on red glaze . Cleanup was not going to be happy about this one .   `` What do you think ? '' Aaron asked , jittery and spooked . It was his first day . Not exactly a good start .   The deputy opened his mouth to respond , then stopped . There was something on the ground , visibly white against the sparkling blood . He bent down and worked it from the gore , then shook his head . `` It 's as I feared . ''   `` What ? '' Aaron asked .   The deputy held the slip of paper to the light . It was a mailing receipt , stained with blood , but a single line in the corner was plainly visible .   https : //shipyourenemiesglitter.com/   The deputy shook his head . `` Looks like this guy got the deluxe package .

They bust in while I slept , tear gas and flash bangs filled my bedroom while I slept , they breached my front door . The power cut , leaving the flash lights of the men dressed in black the only light . They put a bag over my head , promptly beating me as they dragged me out the door while they rummaged through my belongings . Thrown into the back of a vehicle , I was whisked away . Tires screeched , laying on my back as blood began to soak my hood , the heat of the night made it hard to breath . I rolled about as we sped through the streets in this late hour , the occasional gun shot could be heard in the distance . We must have arrived at our destination , dragged from the vehicle , I was placed in a chair . Strapped down , and water boarded without a word said to me . After several rounds , '' So tell bomb maker , '' the Amercan GI said , `` Where is your factory , '' I smiled , '' Praise Allah infidel . '' `` Again , '' the American stated as they leaned me backwards again . For today was a glorious day , killing our Shia and American enemies , I killed at least four when my bombs drove into the market and detonated in the panic .
`` Next chapter , coming soon . ''     *How soon is soon ? * , I wondered to myself . These damn web-novels keep twisting me up with their languid pace . Especially the translated ones . The idea that the story is already out there , just *ready* to be read hurts me in a very real way .     I even tried learning new languages , but I have no talent when it comes to linguistics . What I do have is some proficiency in physics and electronics .     Eventually , these stories will be written . Eventually , they will be translated . Well , all I want to do is take a peek at them . That should n't be so hard , right ? I mean , it is n't like I 'm going to be transferring any *substantial* objects through time .     The theory was difficult . The construction harder . But that damned `` Next chapter , coming soon '' drove me .     Eventually , I was ready for my test run . My first target was a half-completed Writing Prompt with a `` To be continued '' tacked to the end . I figured that a five hour scrape should net me the completed version .     I held my breath and triggered the system .     And time snapped like the delicate thread that it is .
Galactic Cycle 1452 ,   Log 37 , on the solar system containing sentience ,   third planet from their sun , quadrant 23 .   .   The reports of their size are not an exaggeration , even their females stand three heads taller than the tallest Panvarian . They have fairly simple technology , but what is most concerning is the rate of their development , according to their history logs and our own records , they 've accelerated from single shot weapons to automatic weaponry in a mere 300 years , they 've developed remote reconnaissance , and guided rocketry quickly too . At that rate of development , spacefaring technology is but a single tech boom away .   Even without their weapons they 're intimidating creatures ... dissections of their brains indicate there is a gland that releases something they call adrenaline , which makes even some of their weaker specimens the ability to increase their physical prowess three-fold .   Our only saving grace may be their divided nature . Their planets countries are highly divided , with different sovereign states numbering in the hundreds . Hopefully , they remain divided and destroy themselves , if not , the Klauwakins may recruit them in their efforts to sweep the 48th quadrant .   We ca n't let that happen sir .   .

Dan slammed a fist down on the table , `` So . Damn . Close . ''   `` Okay Dan , calm down and tell me about it , '' Steve was another scientist working at the DOD labs . His work was on a Gigawatt Death Ray .   `` Think about it Steve , a million minds all like ours , synthesized in a matter of hours ! One thousand you 's with the exact same mental makeup and ability . I just ca n't solve the power problem ! ''   The other scientist gave him a strange look , `` Just wait until 7pm . The buildings power usage decreases when all the other scientists stop working for the day . You can allocate the extra power . ''   `` That will work ! That will fix it ! Why are you looking at me like that ? ''   `` Dan , I 've told you how to solve that problem two days in a row now . ''   `` Sorry , I must be getting tired . Unfortunately , I ca n't try that solution until tomorrow because the cloning room needs time to sterilize itself after I leave and ... Oh shit . ''
she walks and talks nearly non-stop but everyone is used to it these days , they know her ways and that she wo n't hear them if they tell her to quiet or settle , she just keeps talking and walking , staring into whatever it is she sees in the space before her but you know i think i understand her , i think i can see why she just ca n't stop herself from talking talking talking , it 's almost as though , if you feel that nobody listens when you talk , when you 're saying something serious or profound , why bother talking at all , and if you ca n't live without talking , then why not just keep babbling on , if no one listens anyway , why not just talk to please yourself , always talking , never stopping , heedless of who listens , who answers , not that they ever do , you know , but i guess , if these things are in her head , who 's to say , who 's to know because all that comes out is just the same old thing , the same old mutterings that she just ca n't seem to stop , about her babies , about the life she used to have , the girl she was , do you remember her , she sometimes asks the air , do n't you remember her at all , she was so lovely , so full of promise and then one day she just started staring , just started pacing and mumbling , and would n't it be nice to be that girl again ?
In the beginning , I used to have all sorts of reasons I wanted to live : `` to Create something '' , `` to Help people '' , and `` to Enjoy life '' . Although , they begin to run dry as you come to the end . Everyone has that moment , when you know you are truly done experiencing this moment called life .   I 've been around for twice the time a normal person has , and people have noticed . My body is of a fully grown man , my mind is sharp , but my hair has lost its color . No one on this earth has hair of silver . There are some who do not search for me , they ask me , `` Why do you live this long , sir ? ''   I say , `` If you do not wish to know , when I speak to The God of Death , you be far come morning . ''   I 'm hunted now , for there are those who wish to hear my vow . Although , they never tell my reasoning to others . Some plead to Death , some beg me for mercy , and others try to vow alike I , but The God accepts blood once it has been spilled . When I wake , one of these hunters will , yet again , be my sacrifice to Death .   `` To serve you , my Lord . ''
Although things may seem glum around the castle , because , as you know , the hero is dead , and the princess ... oh , the poor princess ... the lives of the commonfolk go on as usual , with a few `` unintended '' benefits .   No longer are we harassed by the town friar . His rantings and ravings can be heard no more , as the evil king 's men had behead him on the first dawn of his newly-crowned rule . Us , the commonfolk , now live in peace and tranquility , a soundscape they had never known before , except in the darkest of night .   The difference between the social castes have dwindled to one of three categories : the king , his trusted royal guard , and the king 's peasants . There are no longer distinctions between classes , except that the peasants do all of the physical labor within the country . We all receive torture of some kind .   The king also enlisted every man , as well as woman , into the army , as a way to make up for the military might that was lost in the siege for the castle . Equality ... it 's funny , it took an evil king to provide me with such an outlook .   These blackest of days-   *sword unsheathes* -are n't all that bad , until the king comes to ... *squelch* ...   *Blood spills on the ground . *
This . I 've done this before . Oh , yeah , that 's the spot . Right there . Hnnngggggg ...   Huh ? What 's this ? It 's shiny . And cold . What are those symbols ? Master seems to think they 're a good thing . And that 's absolutely the best thing ever ! Now we 're going over here . Neat , a table . Oh ! I know this one ! They want me to jump .   Wow , I like it up here . Hello , master ! I love you ! Yes , and the scratches . I love the scratches ! Yeah , I feel something on my leg , but it 's not a bug . I 've done this before ! And he always gives me treats after this ! And then we go back to the sandy place !   Is that all ? One tiny bug bite and sit on a shiny ? Nothing else this time ? Okay , cool ! Treat ? Treat ? No treat ? Alright , that 's okay ! Aww , we 're leaving already ? I did n't smell everything ! Okay , fine , I 'll wear that vest again . But I still love you , master ! Can we go on a walk ? No pop-stick this time , that hurts my ears sometimes . But we can go chase a squirrel !   Now it 's time for the car ! I love the car ! And master ! I love them all !
Pilot Bill was in a panic , he looked at his read outs and read each with deepening concern ...   **PROPULSION : OFF-LINE**   ... In fact the engines were not giving any readings at all ! Pressure or otherwise . It was like they were not even there !   **ALTIMETER : 123,456**   ... He knew he was losing altitude fast , but the readout never changed . A rush of fear washed over Bill as he realized he would have to manually bring the craft in without knowing his altitude or approach . Utterly random .   **CONTROL SURFACES ... **   **FLAPS : OFF-LINE ( ERROR ) **   **AILERON : OFF-LINE ( ERROR ) **   **RUDDER : OFF-LINE ( ERROR ) **   **ELEVATOR : OFF-LINE ( ERROR ) **   ... None of the control surfaces even registered . Bill pounded the console in frustration .   **ELEVATOR : OFF-LINE ( LOCKED ) **   Suddenly the rearmost controllers registered on . Great , locked . Whatever configuration they were in now was how they will be all the way down .   Any second now , this would be it .     AUTHORS NOTE : I do n't write often . I 'm better with concepts .  
The plane dives again , and everyone is screaming . The carnage in front of you suddenly is ripped away , as if it never existed . Instead , only open air , where people get sucked out . The piece you , your friend , and the rest of your grade is hurtling towards a city . You see the CN Tower , and you realize you 're going to crash in Toronto . You desperately hope this is a dream .   But it 's not . You have insomnia . There really are about 550 people that are about to , or have already died on this flight . You 're flying over what should be Markham .   You piece is the wing section , where you and about 100 others sat on your return trip to Markham . You 're sitting next to your best friend who you knew since Grade 1 .   The wreckage lands un-gracefully in a forest , and you 're launched out .   You 're flying . You 're flying . You 're flying . You 're dead .   Your legs explodes from the impact with the ground . You 're barely alive . Your friend survived , but you can see more pieces raining down . The tail crushes part of the cabin , and a large piece of debris flies up . It crushes your friend .   You 're not sad . You 're happy . At last , this is the sleep you 've been waiting for .   You 're beginning to drift off , into the black void .
I never realized there was another world beyond the mirror . I always took Lewis 's beyond the looking glass as fiction . Until I saw myself killed in the mirror . 99.9 % of realities are identical because parallel universes are connected but I fell into the .1 percent . The irregularity in our universes happened when I was looking in the mirror , every universe is separated by a single choice and I saw the difference in our universes myself . I was killed and the person who did it could n't see ME through the mirror , but I saw him . Who was he why did he kill me ? I do n't know but i have to know . I tried for the first time touching the mirror since my `` reflection '' was killed , my hand went through and I decided to make the choice to go find what that single choice between my life and death was .   I 'm going beyond the looking glass and I do n't know if I 'll be coming back . But it does n't matter I realize it never mattered , I 'm one of many and we will always find our way through
sometimes when I am having a bad day i like to try to find answers in the bottom of a bottle of whiskey . It is a lot like trying to get a woman to cum vaginally most likely you will not succeed but it is sure as hell fun trying . Come to think of it , sometimes when i have a bad day I like to try to make a woman cum vaginally . Lately I have been feeling like a god damned Plinko Chip , just bouncing randomly to some inevitable end beyond my control . Will I win $ 10,000 or a big fat goose egg . I would say the Price Is Right is n't the same since Bob Barker left , But I have been gainfully employed for too long to know . So that is something . While I enjoyed it when I was a kid I hope to never watch the Price Is Right again , because if I am , it means I have truly fucked up my life . Why the hell is there a phone book on my front step ? I should bury it in the god damn ground , because what it really is , is a book of people statistically more likely to die soon . I do n't think I know anyone under 35 who is listed in a phone book ... Man I feel better . Thank you cmonfriday I needed that .
It was a normal night at the club and I was standing at the bar . There was a beautiful woman standing in at the other end stealing small looks my way . I let my eyes linger on her until they lock with those black pearls . Playfully twisting her hair with her finger , she giggles , returning to talk to the bartender . A small smirk was given as I hear the song come on . Whispering softly “ And now… we dance… ” I lift myself off the bar stool and glide towards her . Holding out my hand to her , palm facing upwards , I ask her to dance . Her hand gently falls down like a leaf in autumn fall , caressing mine and we proceed to the dance floor . I placed my hand upon her hip , when I dipped , she dipped , and we dipped . She put hers and I put mine and we got down low and rolled it round . There was a fade out of the song and slowly the new song crept in . We smiled and laughed . It was like we almost knew what was going on between us . We went to the left , to the left , proceeding on back to the right , and to the right . Switching up , we went to the front , to the front , and then to the back , to the back . I could feel something in my chest coming on which felt like a whoop . I swear on that cotton candy , sweet and low , I just wanted to see this girl tootsie roll .
I had never had free will . I was a product of ancient genie magic , a tool , a prop . My life had no other meaning than to look good , My mind was a blank slate . All I had ever known was to exist for one purpose .   After I had done what I was meant to do in this world I wandered around for years . The Master had not seen it important to make me and my brothers and sisters age like humans born from the love to one and another . But it was still life I lived , and life always finds a way .   Many generations later I found a new beginning in the United States Army . I fought for freedom across the globe , utterly without fear ; for I knew if I was wished to being once , I would be wished to being again in an universe of infinite possibilities . This impressed and intrigued my superiors and I rose through the ranks swiftly .   And when I moved silently in the midst of thick undergrowth , on some god-forsaken Pacific island , completely invisible , the nanosuit pumping my blood full of chemicals , I felt like a genie myself and knew I had found my place .
Ever since the dawn of our world they have always beaten us . It was written into our atoms , our very building blocks , to be defeated . It was coded into our souls .   We wanted only to have our kingdoms . But we always sat on thrones of lies , given false servants who never truly believed in us . At a moment 's notice they turned on us , over and over , time after time . They joined the Light , helped them in their revolutionary quests , and we were destroyed from the inside . The Light always saw this as divine proof that they were the destined ones .   Today this ends . We are few , and we have no armies like the Light does . We are n't as strong , or as nimble . We are slow , and weak , and programmed to die for the purpose of the Light 's fun . Even our makers made us to fall . But we will never give up .   Waluigi , Joker . Doomsday , Dr. Robotnix , Amon . Posiedon , Scarecrow . All who have struggled , hear me , Bowser , today as we retake our timelines and reset what our worlds have become .   Join me , and we shall return the consoles to darkness !
She was beautiful as can be . Glitter specked her chestnut brown hair , which was twisted into an elegant up-do . Modest , yet flattering , the stunning dress the groom had bought for his love drew every gaze toward her . Taking her father 's arm , Annette prepared to walk down the aisle .   Mr. Garner bent his head and whispered into his daughter 's ear .   `` Remember what we talked about , '' he rasped , his breath stale . `` Do n't lose sight of your purpose . ''   The soon-to-be-Mrs. Hardy rolled her eyes . `` Dad , I 'm a grown woman now . I think I can take care of myself . ''   `` Annie , '' the man struggled to keep his voice to a whisper . `` I 'm serious . Before you do anything , make sure he signs those papers . ''   Music filled the church , and everyone turned in their pews to watch the bride glide down the aisle . Gripping her father 's arm tighter , Annette donned a fresh smile and whispered into his ear .   `` Do n't worry , Father . By the end of the month , we 'll be *rich* . ''  
The world did not end .   This little blue marble hovering in the void did not crumble and shatter into fragments beyond number .   This fact did not seem really true to me at the time .   You did not leave me whole . You did not walk away from a man still complete with all his original pieces . You did not turn back .   There were no tears . No screams in the night . No sitting in the darkness , hoping , begging , again and again to wake up from the nightmarish reality of my own making . At least , none that I will ever admit to .   There was no sudden moment of clarity . No internal switch was flipped and nothing substantial changed over time to break the pattern of self-loathing and self-destruction .   And yet , the pattern did not last forever .   I did not get over you . I did not forget what you did , and what it meant to me . But I do not live in the past any more .   I did not stay only what you saw in me . I did not accept that . You did not see that I was only a first rough draft of something much bigger when you skim read my pages and found me lacking .   Whatever parts of me that I thought you took with you , you did not really take . I did not understand at the time that I was whole before and after you . I , like you , did not see my potential .   The world did not end .   And , surprisingly , neither did I .
I 'd killed someone .   I'd- I 'd killed someone .   Accident , they said it was . How was I meant to know ? Two scientist still in their labcoats pretending to be so much cleverer than me . 'Oh , some H20 . ' Stuck up dick . He could n't say the word *water* ? Does he ask people to pass the sodium chloride as well ?   So when the other one said , yeah , I want H202 , it did n't seem that odd . Everyone knows what H20 is but I studied English at university and H202 meant nothing to me . A quick google in the back told me all I needed to know . A few chemical reactions later and they seemed satisfied with their drinks .   Until one fell down dead .   Yeah , you guessed it , the H202 guy . 'No , he was saying H20 *too* ' the other scientist kept on yelling at me , but how was I know ? Normal people would 've said they 'd like some water as well , please . Yeah , they did n't even say please . Ca n't say the word water and ca n't say the word please , I do n't think it 's much of a loss , but still- dead . I shudder just thinking about it . I mean , in this job , I 've seen a fair few pub brawls ( religious leaders are quite violent and I now have a healthy fear of rabbis ) and a strange number of people who walk through the doors just to fall unconscious , but a death ?
`` How many times do I need to tell you , N'wah , I do n't need 15 more cheap swords ... I have n't even moved the last load of random shirts and plates you sold me . Where are you getting these anyways ? ''   The adventurer shrugs . `` Oh you know , contracts with the fighters guild , finding them in caves , that sort of thing . ''   `` This ... this fur armor still has blood on it . ''   `` Hey relax , he had a bounty on him . '' As I was told this he pulled out a spear out of seemingly nowhere and laid it on the counter . `` This here is a spear that will trap the souls of those slain , it also shocks people . Exciting right ? How many septims can I get ? ''   `` Where did ... How ... Look , you 're starting to creep me out . I just want to sell boots to people who have theirs ruined by guars . This is getting out of hand . I 'm going to have to go talk to an Ordinator or some -- ''   < Loud buzzing and whoosh and green light >   `` -- And yet ... . I ca n't help but just really like you . I just trust you for some reason . How much did you say this spear was worth ? I should have no problem selling it so someone . Hell , I 'll throw in a discount , just for you , Outlander ! ''
As i was putting on my last bit of gear , one of the others came to me with a puzzled looking in its face . How can you be so calm he asked . I replied with a smile , war is a way of life for us , its all we know ! I picked up my helmet and walked away joining my fellow brothers and sisters wile we amassed by the thousands at the space port . Wile waiting there the atmosphere was excited . you can hear comments about how many kills they will get or what it will be like to kill an alien for the first time . I stood there thinking about how many rounds i have . Do I have any grenades , is my air filtration system charged . The thought of why the alien was confused never cross my mind at that moment . As we started to walk onboard the atmosphere got serious as everyone realized that there is no turning back now . we are going to a foreign planet ! we are going to to fight and die in Planet that is not our own , and some of us may never see the planet we call home . But the only Comfort we have is the fact that we are going to war and as human beings we know that all too well .

I remember the day that the mailman came and handed him what I can only assume were love letters . He took one look at them and threw them in the trash . I remember the day that the television had a picture of a younger and better groomed dachshund on it and he changed the channel without thinking . I remember the day that he heroically chased the squirrel from our lawn because ( I 'm sure ) he did n't want to see blood on my claws . He was my everything . How could I know . How could I know ?   He brought *her* home . I know that lots of men fantasize about a three-way . I would n't have blamed him for it , if he 'd kept it in the recesses of his mind . I too , have my fantasies . But this ? *This ? *   She was fluffier than me . I know that . Her paws were cuter than mine - objectively . And I can not lie , as much as I like to think of myself as a modern canine , it hurt that she was a cat . But the disgusting thing ? The truly soul destroying *monstrousness* of it ?   She was just a kitten .   She was just a kitten .
The night was exhilarating . Bright lights , countless handshakes , cameras and eyes that seemed to all be focused on me . Two years of late nights and stress enough to make my adrenal gland explode .   My wife and I were being escorted to our limo when secret service pulled me aside , `` A moment Mr . President ? '' I shared a glance with my wife and kissed her forehead . `` Go home , I love you , '' I said . I knew based on the last two years that it would be longer than 'a moment ' that I would be called aside .   I was escorted to a quiet side room , an inelegant place with plastic folded chairs and white walls . My head was lofty still on adrenaline . The chief of the FBI entered the room behind me , and to my surprise , the sitting president entered after . I assumed they would want to congratulate me in private , or share a celebratory nightcap . Our greetings were brief and formal .   The sitting president leaned in close . `` I have something important to tell you , '' he said . The solemnity he expressed in his eyes was grounding . In an instant , I sunk down from the rush of the evening .   `` Earth is an experiment , '' he said , `` and you are the new director of the experiment . Congratulations . '' I saw in his eyes that this was a terrible fate .
It was the screams that woke me up , oddly enough . Many thousands of tons of jell-o suddenly collapsing on top of a small town should be quite loud . I suppose the screams pierce through reinforced concrete more than the thud-sploosh of delicious death that fell from the sky .   It was inexplicable . As I opened the hatch to my bunker where I spent most nights , the goop fell around me and I tasted it as some got in my mouth . At least it was strawberry . The screams got louder as I walked down the path towards the main part of town .   Everything was absolutely covered . Sticky . I could n't tell who was bleeding out or crushed , and who was just going for a swim in the town 's new pools of jell-o that coalesced after the initial impact .   I found old Jon Bopkins sitting on what remained of the porch of his house , smoking a pipe . I had to know what happened -- and Jon was sure to know .   `` Jon just where the hell did this jell-o come from ? ''   He just pointed .   There flew an aircraft pulling a streamer-sign . `` JELL-OME BY OBAMA ''   I scratched my head and then licked the sugary residue off of my fingers .   `` Well , '' I said to Jon , `` thanks , Obama . ''   I wished he would have taken that third term .
I went to enter a pun contest . I entered ten puns . My first pun was as follows :   I went to watch a play about puns . The play was called `` A Play on Words . ''   The next pun that I entered was `` The clown could n't go to work today because he did n't have the balls to do it . ''   The next pun that I entered was `` The hares escaped the zoo . Nobody could find them . Local authorities were combing the area . ''   The fourth pun was : My teacher calls me a chicken because I have a hard time coming out of my shell .   The fifth pun was `` A boy swallowed some coins and was taken to a hospital . When his mom telephoned to ask how he was a nurse said , ‘ No change yet . ''   The sixth pun was not very punny .   The seventh pun was `` Grandma wo n't let me tell people to 'eat crow . ' She said it is a four letter bird . ''   The eight pun was `` the energizer bunny was arrested for assault and battery ''   The ninth pun was `` A business man who wanted more ties bought some in Thailand where ties are very collar full . ''   The tenth pun was this joke .   I asked the judges to see if I won . Out of all of the puns that I entered , NO PUN IN TEN DID !
So , here we are . The end of life .   6135 years old . Over 600 small deaths and resurrections , most by my own hand to get a fresh body .     I 've done a lot during my six millennia . I 've seen every corner of the world , done every drug , had sex with in every conceivable way , most of it as both genders after sex change operations became as quick as dyeing your hair .   I even tried dying of old age once , that was a let down after 70 years of becoming weaker every day .     6117 years ago I chose the event of an mass extinction sized asteroid hitting earth . It seemed like a reasonable choice at the time .   It was far off in the future , and who would want to rebuild everything after something like that anyway , it is going to take hundreds of years of hard work to get back to where we are today .   Nah , let other people worry about that as they hurry trying to bury what they think they can salvage after the event . Let them resurrect in excruciating pain over and over until the planet is survivable again .   I 'll just sit here watching the sky catch on fire , waiting for the end .     Still , even knowing all that , all I can think is   'I do n't want to die '  
It was the end of September , a cold Friday night .   I remember it perfectly , as though it where nothing more than a story I had written down that night , and I was reading out to my friend .   I was about to bag the biggest score of the year- the world 's luckiest man was standing in front of me , about fifty yards away ; I locked my safety off of the silenced pistol and prepared to shoot .   He ducked . The bastard actually ducked , despite my precise aim ...   I tried about five times to hit him , losing each time . he went to tie his shoelace , or looked in the other direction as though something called to him .   I could n't take it . I brought out my nail bat and prepared to do it Manhunt style .   I walked up behind him and swung downwards , but despite my quick movement , he walked away like nothing happened . I continued swinging , missing every single time , until finally I gave up .   I called the client the next day , paid back the money and went on with my life .   ( hope you like- It 's my first one )
The plumber ran from the unfamiliar ; seven foot tall extra terrestrials gave chase . They grunted and groaned like nothing he 'd ever heard . He was in the subway when one showed up , causing everyone to run into the tunnel . Vinnie stared the alien in it 's eyes before it blasted him with it 's weapon .   As he ran away he tasted the familiar water that covered his body . The creatures must not have done their homework if they assume that will hurt humans . But they are still big and scary so he did n't want to take any chances .   He ducked into a service area and peeked back at the pursuers . Tall lanky scaled beasts with six legs . Some of them were blue , others green , with some in between . Their eyes were impossibly huge and their teeth looked like doctor 's needles .   He saw a child hiding in plain sight , right in the path of the aliens . Vinnie wanted to do something to help but he 's just a plumber , what does he know ?   The creatures picked the child up and hissed in its face . They proceeded to lick the child 's entire head before leaving it behind . When the coast was clear he approached the silent kid .   `` Hey Kid are you ok ? ''   `` I 'm ok , just smell like fish now is all , '' said the little girl .
